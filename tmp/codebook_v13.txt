• New external variables
- Number of coups attempts in a year (e_pt_coup_attempts)
- Index of Democratization (e_vanhanen)
• Other new or modified information
• V-Dem Datasets
- The country-date and coder-level datasets have both increased in size: since v13, we have inserted January 1st (e.g. 1990-01-01) for all variables except for those that are election date-specific. Before v13, observations at December 31st (e.g. 1990-12-31) could be interpreted as the score that applies to the full year. This is not the case any longer and thus no date for these variables have a special meaning. Finally, although the country-year datasets are aggregated from the country-date structure, it is not affected by this.
- Election date-specific variables in the country-year datasets are now interpolated between elections and across years that belong to the same electoral regime (see v2x_elecreg). However, the country-date and coder-level datasets only have observations on the actual election-dates.
• Regimes survey
- Bug fix for variables that are aggregated across coders using the mode: v2regopploc, v2regproreg, v2regpower, v2regimpoppgroup, v2regantireg v2regsuploc, and v2regimpgroup. These variables now reflect the mode whereas in versions v9 to v11.1 the bug caused them to not always do so.
• Removed versions of indices and indicators
- Historical V-Dem indicators with v3-tags are continuously merged with the corresponding contemporary V-Dem v2-indicators. This results in the removal of v3-indicators, but extension of the time series (further back in time) of the corresponding v2-indicators. The year coverage is indicated in the "years" section for each variable entry.
For more details on changes to previous versions of the dataset, please see Appendix F or the specific version of the codebook. All previous codebook versions are available at https://www.v-dem.net/ data/dataset-archive/.
1.2 Cautionary Notes
V-Dem is firmly committed to full transparency and release of the data that we have. However, we do ask users to take the following cautions into consideration when using our data.
• The V-Dem Methodology assumes five or more coders for the "contemporary" period starting from 1900, originally coded to 2012. With the updates covering 2013-2022 it has for a few country-variable combinations been impossible to achieve that target. From analysis, we have found that this at times can result in significant changes in point estimates, most likely as a consequence of self-selected attrition of Country Experts, rather than actual meaninful changes in the latent state of a given country. We therefore strongly advise against using point estimates for variable-years where a country has three or fewer ratings. We suggest to filter these out before conducting any type of analysis. Since v7, we include a variable that for every expertcoded variable, suffixed with "_nr", shows the count of ratings per country-year and variable.
1.2 Cautionary Notes
• Point estimates can jump around slightly due to the simulation-based nature of the estimation process and expert turnover. Consumers of the data should therefore always be attentive to the uncertainty about the estimates. Further, the uncertainty also provides vital information about the degree to which one can be certain that a change in a score reflects an actual change in the level of the concept being measured.
• We constantly improve the coding of factual data (A) to make it as accurate as possible. This may result in changes at the index-level.
• Observations for Exclusion and Legitimation indicators (section 3.13 and section 3.14) with less than three coders per country-date (*_nr < 3) have been removed. Furthermore, observations for Exclusion indices (section 5.6) have been removed if not at least 3 components have at least 3 coders per country-date.
• Observations for Civic and Academic Space indicators (section 3.15) with less than 3 coders per country-date (*_nr < 3) have been removed.
• These variables had issues with convergence: v2caconmob, v2cademmob, v2cainsaut, v2capolit, v2catrauni, v2clacjust, v2cltrnslw, v2dlcommon, v2dlencmps, v2elembcap, v2elffelrbin, v2elintim, v2elpdcamp, v2elpeace, v2elpubfin, v2exdjcbhg, v2jupoatck, v2lgdomchm, v2lginvstp, v2peasbgen, v2peasjgeo, v2peasjsoecon, v2pehealth, v2pepwrgeo, v2psprlnks, v2regoppgroupssize, v2smgovab, v2smpolhate, v2x_accountability, v2x_neopat, v2xdl_delib, v2xeg_eqdr, v2xlg_legcon, v2xnp_client, v2xpe_exlecon, v2xpe_exlgender, v2xpe_exlgeo. Please see individual codebook entries for additional information. For details on interpreting convergence information, please refer to 1.4.5, the Methodology Document and Pemstein et al. (2023).
• We further ask you to use the following percentage variables with caution:
- Female journalists (v2mefemjrn)
- Weaker civil liberties population (v2clsnlpct)
• Historical V-Dem: In the coding of several Historical V-Dem A-type variables, the historical part of the time series-including 20 years of overlap with the "contemporary" time series (typically 1900-1920)-were conducted completely independently from the existing coding in the original V-Dem dataset, by one or more new coders. For many of these historical variables, we have gone through and checked the consistency of the coding, further scrutinized the sources, and determined which coding represents the most appropriate score after deliberation. We have subsequently made the appropriate adjustments to the data.
For other historical A variables we have yet to finalize this process. For these variables, the scores reported for the overlap period (typically 1900-1920) in the dataset are the "contemporary" VDem scores, by default. This means that for some countries, where there is disagreement in the historical and contemporary coding in the starting year for the contemporary time series (typically 1900), there may be artificial changes between that year and the year before that do not necessarily reflect a real-world change in the political system in the country. Hence, we advise users to exert caution before running analysis on the entire time series extending across both the historical and contemporary coding periods.
Please also note that for the variables where there is not full correspondence between the historical (1789-1920) and contemporary (1900-2022) coding, the historical coding of the variables is also provided in their original form as separate variables, carrying a "v3" rather than a "v2" prefix on the variable tag. These "v3" variables are gathered together with a number of new (A and C type) variables that are currently only coded for the Historical V-Dem sample, in a separate section of the codebook.

1.4 Variable Information
1.4.1	Variable Types
The V-Dem Codebook divides variables into the following variable types:
• Type A*: Variables coded by Project Managers and Research Assistants
This data is based on extant sources and is factual in nature. Country Experts indicate their confidence for this pre-coded data.
• Type A: Variables coded by Project Managers and Research Assistants This data is based on extant sources and is factual in nature.
• Type B: Variables coded by Country Coordinators or Research Assistants The coder is typically a graduate student or recent graduate from the country in question. These variables are factual in nature.
• Type C: Variables coded by Country Experts
A Country Expert is typically a scholar or professional with deep knowledge of a country and of a particular political institution. Furthermore, the expert is usually a citizen or resident of the country. Multiple experts (usually 5 or more) code each variable. More information about the Country Experts can be found in the V-Dem Methodology document.
• Type A,C: Variables coded by Country Experts and crosschecked by Research
Assistants
These variables are based on expert-generated data which is in a second stage processed by a research assistant for quality control.
• Type D: Indices
Variables composed of type A, B, or C variables. This data may be accomplished by adding a denominator (e.g., per capita), by creating a cumulative scale (total number of...), or by aggregating larger concepts (e.g., components or indices of democracy).
• Type E: Non-V-Dem variables
If we import a variable from another source without doing any original coding, except for perhaps imputing missing data, it is not considered a V-Dem product. These variables are found in the sections of the Codebook labeled Background Factors and Other Democracy Indices and Indicators. If, however, we gather data from a number of sources and combine them in a more than purely mechanical fashion (requiring some judgment on our part), we regard this as a V-Dem product and classify it as type A, B, or C. All "E" variables, except those drawn from sources that have more than 30 variables, are included in the codebook. For this reason, the following examples are not included; Archigos (Goemans et al.), BDM (Bueno de Mesquita et al.), Henisz/POLCON (2000, 2002), Miller (Democratic Pieces), Performance of Nations (Kugler and Tammen), PEI (Norris et al.), PIPE (Przeworski et al.) and QoG (Quality of Government). For these and for similar cases, we ask users to consult separate codebooks, as listed above.

1.4.3	Variable Versions and Suffixes
The V-Dem Dataset contains several versions of the variables coded by country experts (type C variables).
• Model Estimates
"Model Estimates" - Measurement Model Output:
This version has no special suffix (e.g. v2elmulpar). This version of the variables provides country-year (country-date in the alternative dataset) point estimates from the V-Dem measurement model (see Pemstein et al. 2022). The measurement model aggregates the ratings provided by multiple country experts and, taking disagreement and measurement error into account, produces a probability distribution over country-year scores on a standardized interval scale (see the V-Dem Methodology document). The point estimates are the median values of these distributions for each country-year. The scale of a measurement model variable is similar to a normal ("Z") score (e.g. typically between -5 and 5, with 0 approximately representing the mean for all country-years in the sample) though it does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. For most purposes, these are the preferred versions of the variables for time series regression and other estimation strategies. "Model Estimates Measure of Uncertainty" - Measurement Model Highest Posterior Density (HPD) Intervals:
This version has the suffixes: "codelow" and "codehigh" (e.g. v2elmulpar_codelow and v2elmulpar_codehigh). These two kinds of variables ["code low" and "code high"] demarcate the interval in which the measurement model places 68 percent of the probability mass for each country-year score, which is approximately equivalent to one standard deviation upper and lower bounds. If the underlying posterior distribution is skewed, the HPDs reflect this with unequal distances between the point estimate and the high and low estimates. We also provide a standard calculation for standard deviation which is marked with the suffix "sd" (e.g., v2elmulpar_sd). The SD might be used to compute the standard frequentist confidence intervals.
• Original Scale (*_osp)
"Original Scale" - Linearized Original Scale Posterior Prediction:
This version has the suffix "_osp," (e.g. v2elmulpar_osp). In this version of the variables, we have linearly translated the measurement model point estimates back to the original ordinal scale of each variable (e.g. 0-4 for v2elmulpar_osp) as an interval measure. The decimals in the _osp version roughly indicate the distance between the point estimate from the linearized measurement model posterior prediction and the threshold for reaching the next level on the original ordinal scale. Thus, a _osp value of 1.25 indicates that the median measurement model posterior predicted value was closer to the ordinal value of 1 than 2 on the original scale. Technically, it calculates the sum of the posterior probabilities that the estimate is in a particular category: If a particular country-year-variable has a probability of 90% to be in category "4", a 10% probability of being in category "3", and 0% probability of being in categories "2", "1", and "0", the result is a value of 3.9 (4 * 0.9 + 3 * 0.1 = 3.6 + 0.3). Since there is no conventional theoretical justification for linearly mapping ordinal posterior predictions onto an interval scale, these scores should primarily be used for heuristic purposes. Using the "Ordinal Scale" estimates-or incorporating the properties of ordinal probit models into the estimation procedure-is thus preferable to using the _osp estimates in statistical analyses. However, since the _osp version maps onto the coding criteria found in the V-Dem Codebook, and is strongly correlated with the Measurement Model output (typically at .98 or higher), some users may find the _osp version useful in estimating quantities such as marginal effects with a clear substantive interpretation. If a user uses _osp data in statistical analyses it is imperative that she confirm that the results are compatible with estimations using Measurement Model output. "Original Scale Measure of Uncertainty" - Linearized Original
Scale HPD Intervals:
This version has the suffixes "codelow" and "codehigh" (e.g. v2elmulpar_osp_codelow and v2elmulpar_osp_codehigh). We estimate these quantities in a similar manner as the Measurement Model Highest Posterior Density Intervals. These two variables ["code low" and "code high"] demarcate the interval in which the measurement model places 70 percent of the probability mass for each country-year score, which is approximately equivalent to one standard deviation upper and lower bounds. If the underlying posterior distribution is skewed, the HPDs reflect this with unequal distances between the point estimate and the high and low estimates. We also provide a standard calculation for standard deviation which is marked with the suffix "sd" (e.g., v2elmulpar_sd). The SD might be used to compute the standard frequentist confidence intervals.
• Ordinal Scale (*_ord)
"Ordinal Scale" - Measurement Model Estimates of Original Scale Value:
This version has the suffix "_ord" (e.g. v2elmulpar_ord). This method translates the measurement model estimates back to the original ordinal scale of a variable (as represented in the Codebook) after taking coder disagreement and measurement error into account. More precisely, it represents the most likely ordinal value on the original codebook scale into which a country-year would fall, given the average coder's usage of that scale. More specifically, we assign each country-year a value that corresponds to its integerized median ordinal highest posterior probability category over Measurement Model output."Ordinal Scale Measure of
Uncertainty" - Original Scale Value HPD Intervals:
This version has the suffixes - "codelow" and "codehigh" (e.g. v2elmulpar_ord_codelow and v2elmulpar_ord_codehigh). We estimate these values in a similar manner as the Measurement Model Highest Posterior Density Intervals. These two variables ["code low" and "code high"] demarcate the interval in which the measurement model places 70 percent of the probability mass for each country-year score, which is approximately equivalent to one standard deviation upper and lower bounds. If the underlying posterior distribution is skewed, the HPDs reflect this with unequal distances between the point estimate and the high and low estimates. We also provide a standard calculation for standard deviation which is marked with the suffix "sd" (e.g. v2elmulpar_sd). The SD might be used to compute the standard frequentist confidence intervals.
• Number of Coders per Country, Variable and Year/Date (*_nr)
The number of V-Dem Country Experts (regular coders, bridge- and lateral coders) who provided data on country, variable and year. V-Dem's methodology is based on the assumption that we have a minimum of five Country Experts for every single country-variable-year. Sometimes, however, we end up with fewer than five Country Experts. From v7 of the Country-Year, and the Country-Date type datasets, we provide all data we have for full transparency. By providing the number of Country Experts for each country-variable-year/date, we suggest that users primarily base analyses on observations based on five or more coders. We strongly advise against using observations based on three or fewer coders. This concerns all C type variables.
• Arithmetic Mean of Coder Answers per Country-Year (*_mean)
It is commonplace to aggregate respondents' data to the level of country or country-year using arithmetic mean in order to merge it with other country-level data. V-Dem Institute provides such variables for every expert-coded variable aggregated by the Measurement Model in Country-Date/Year dataset.
1.4.4	Variable Tags
Every variable has a name and a tag. The tag consists of three or four parts and has the following structure:
Prefix + Index (if V-Dem index) + Section + Abbreviated title
While the prefix specifies the variable type, the letters that follow indicate which section the variable belongs to.
Prefixes
• v2: V-Dem variables (A, B, C)
• v3: Historical V-Dem only variables (A, B, C)
• v2x_: Main indices and component-indices
• v2x[two-letter designation]_: Indices specific for certain areas (see below). For example, v2xel_ would be an index in the election-specific area. Sometimes used in aggregations of higher-level indices (i.e. v2x_ type indices D)
• e_: Non-V-Dem variables (E) and ordinal versions of V-Dem indices.

1.4.5	Variable Entry Clarifications
The following information is available per variable (if applicable):
Project Manager: The team member(s) primarily responsible for designing the indicator/index, and in some cases responsible for the data collection.
Additional versions: Indicates if the variable is also available in the following versions; *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean and/or *_nr. Detailed information about the different versions can be found in section 1.4.3 (Variable Versions and Suffixes).
Available versions: Lists the available variable types (Only applicable for ordinalized versions of indices).
Question: The question that the variable attempts to measure.
Clarification: Definition of key terms, clarification of scope-conditions, contexts, and any other features needed to understand the question (if any). All key terms appear in the Glossary (Appendix B), unless they are specific to a single section (in which case they only appear in the introduction to that section or in the clarifications for particular questions). Key terms are sometimes cross-referenced with hypertext.
Responses: Numeric, Percentage, Text, Date, Countries, or specific response categories (listed below under "Answer-types" and "Scales").
Answer-Types:
Multiple-choice: Where a coder can select only one answer. This is the usual protocol and is therefore not noted.
Multiple-selection: Where a coder can select more than one answer. For most multiple-selection variables, the dataset contains both the original variable as well as a set of dummies for each of the responses.
Ordering (only applicable to a selection of C variables): This relates to the ordering of questions when the coding of one indicator depends upon the coding of other indicators (i.e., whenever there is some alteration of the serial ordering of questions as listed in this document).
Aggregation (only applicable to indices): Explanation of how an index is constructed.
Scale: Dichotomous, Nominal, Ordinal, or Interval/Ratio (Extra response options such as N/A or Other, are not counted as part of this classification).
Cross-Coder Aggregation (only applicable to C variables): IRT, Bayesian ordinal item response theory measurement model (see the V-Dem Methodology document). Available in mode and mean.
Data releases: Indicates dataset version (1-13). Versions respond to changes to the dataset for V-Dem variables (A, B, C, D), including new variables, new indices, corrections to existing variables, and new iterations of the measurement model. Changes are synchronized with Codebook and Methodology documents so that they all share the same version number. The second number (after the decimal point), refers to sub-versions of the data.
Releases to date:
Version 1-4 were only internal releases, thus not publicly available.
v1: March 31, 2014 v2: September 11, 2014 v3: December 17, 2014 v4: March 31, 2015 Version 5-13 are publicly available free of charge.
v5: January 4, 2016 (first public release of data for download) v6: March 31, 2016 v6.2: June, 2016 v7: May 2017 v7.1: July 2017 v8: April 2018 v9: April 2019 v10: March 2020 v11: March 2021 v11.1: March 2021 v12: March 2022 v13: March 2023
Sources: Citations for type-A* and A variables are listed, wherever possible, with complete references in the Bibliography. Note that this coding sometimes rests on numerous country-specific sources, in which case it has not been possible to include all citations. Composite indices (type-D) build on other variables in the V-Dem database, which are therefore listed as the source for that index.
Date specific: Specifies if observations are coded on specific dates only e.g. election dates.
Cleaning: Specifies if observations are set to missing based on values from other variables.
Citation: Suggested citation when using the specific variable.
Convergence: V-Dem assesses convergence among expert-coded variables using the Gelman-Rubin Diagnostic. Specifically, we consider a variable to have converged if no more than 5% of parameters in each of the relevant parameter sets (universal thresholds, main-country-coded thresholds, expert thresholds, expert reliability, and country-date latent trait estimates) has Rb= 1.01. We assess BFA convergence in a similar manner across relevant model parameter sets (intercept, slope, measurement standard error, and country-date latent trait estimates), but using Rb = 1.1. We provide convergence information for a given variable only if a set of model parameters did not converge, reporting these set(s). Note that if country-date latent trait estimates converged (i.e. we do not mention them in the convergence details) it means that the convergence issues likely reflect a problem with model parameter identification, and the latent trait estimates are relatively safe.
Years: Available coverage for the respective variable. For more information on country-specific year coverage, see the country table.
Note: Additional information about the variable.

1.5 Notes on Methodology
1.5.1	Index Aggregation
The V-Dem conceptual scheme recognizes several levels of aggregation. The table below shows the structure of aggregation for one of our high-level indices: The V-Dem Electoral Democracy Index. This index consists of five sub-components (each of these sub-components being indices themselves built from a number of indicators) that together capture Dahl's seven institutions of polyarchy: freedom of association, suffrage, clean elections, elected executive, and freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.
Appendix A includes a table with a complete hierarchy of our democracy indices, democracy component indices, democracy sub- component indices, and indicators, as well as the hierarchy of related concept indices.
Note: High-level indices which have components that are calculated using the measurement model and/or Bayesian factor analysis use the posterior samples of these components for calculating index scores and confidence intervals (68% highest posterior density intervals).


*Unmodeled Variance. Uniqueness is the variance that is 'unique' to the variable and not shared with other variables.
1.5.2	Country-Year Aggregation
C-variables, ratio/percentage variables, and High-Level/Mid-Level Democracy indices are aggregated from the country-date level to the country-year level by the day-weighted mean. Ordinal A-variables and A*-variables are aggregated by taking the last observation in the year with one exception: eventspecific dichotomies or event-specific ordinal variables, which mostly concerns elections or election related data, are aggregated by max (meaning the highest observed value for a given year is retained) to reflect that an "event" of the coded type occurred within the year.
1.5.3	Open source code
Starting with version 11 of the V-Dem dataset we are releasing the code that is used for creating the V-Dem datasets to the public at https://github.com/vdeminstitute/dataset_construction.

1.7 Identifier Variables in the V-Dem Datasets
1.7.1	Country Name (country_name)
Name of coded country. A V-Dem country is a political unit enjoying at least some degree of functional and/or formal sovereignty. For more details on country units consult the V-Dem Country Coding Units document.
Response: Text.
1.7.2	Time-Specific Country Name (histname)
Time-specific name of coded country. Many countries go by different names in different time-periods, for example due to name changes, changes in territory, colonization, occupation, or independence. This variable contains a brief description of the identity of each polity that comprises a country's history. This variable is based on the V-Dem Country Coding Units document.
Response: Text.
1.7.3	V-Dem Country ID (country_id)
Unique country ID designated for each country. A list of countries and their corresponding IDs used in the V-Dem dataset can be found in the country table in the codebook, as well as in the V-Dem Country Coding Units document.
Response: Numeric.
1.7.4	Country Name Abbreviation (country_text_id)
Abbreviated country names.
Response: Text.
1.7.5	Year (year)
V-Dem year coded annually from 1789-2022. This variable is included in the V-Dem Country Year as well as Country Date datasets.
Response: Date.
1.7.6	Historical Date (historical_date)
This variable is included in the V-Dem Country Date dataset and the coder-level dataset. As of v13, December 31st as in 2022-12-31, is no longer the default date. When experts provide ratings in the online interface, the default date is still December 31st. However, in our data processing pipeline we add January 1st to all variables except election-date specific ones. This has the effect that December 31st is no longer representative of the full year. This variable also exists in the country-year dataset, but has no direct meaning in that context and should not be preferred over the year column.
Response: Date.
1.7.7	Start of Coding Period (codingstart)
V-Dem country coding starts in 1789, or from when a country first enjoyed at least some degree of functional and/or formal sovereignty. For detailed information, please see the V-Dem Country Coding Units document.

2 V-Dem Democracy Indices
2.1 V-Dem High-Level Democracy Indices
This section groups together macro-level indices that describe features of democracy at the highest (most abstract) level. Please see Appendix A for an overview of all indices, component-indices, and lower-level indices.
2.1.1	Electoral democracy index (D) (v2x_polyarchy)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the ideal of electoral democracy in its fullest sense achieved?
Clarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to embody the core value of making rulers responsive to citizens, achieved through electoral competition for the electorate's approval under circumstances when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and elections affect the composition of the chief executive of the country. In between elections, there is freedom of expression and an independent media capable of presenting alternative views on matters of political relevance. In the V-Dem conceptual scheme, electoral democracy is understood as an essential element of any other conception of representative democracy - liberal, participatory, deliberative, egalitarian, or some other.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2x_freexp_altinf v2x_frassoc_thick v2x_suffr v2xel_frefair v2x_elecoff Data release: 1-13. Release 1-5 used a different, preliminary aggregation formula.
Aggregation: The index is formed by taking the average of, on the one hand, the weighted average of the indices measuring freedom of association thick (v2x_frassoc_thick), clean elections (v2xel_frefair), freedom of expression (v2x_freexp_altinf), elected officials (v2x_elecoff), and suffrage (v2x_suffr) and, on the other, the five-way multiplicative interaction between those indices. This is half way between a straight average and strict multiplication, meaning the average of the two. It is thus a compromise between the two most well known aggregation formulas in the literature, both allowing partial "compensation" in one sub-component for lack of polyarchy in the others, but also punishing countries not strong in one sub-component according to the "weakest link" argument. The aggregation is done at the level of Dahl's subcomponents with the one exception of the non-electoral component. The index is aggregated using this formula:
v2x_polyarchy = .5 * MPI + .5 * API
= .5 * (v2x_elecoff * v2xel_frefair * v2x_frassoc_thick*
v2x_suffr * v2x_freexp_altinf)
+ .5 * ((1/8) * v2x_elecoff + (1/4) * v2xel_frefair
+ (1/4) * v2x_frassoc_thick + (1/8) * v2x_suffr
+ (1/4) * v2x_freexp_altinf)

2.1 V-Dem High-Level Democracy Indices
2.1.2	Liberal democracy index (D) (v2x_libdem)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the ideal of liberal democracy achieved?
Clarification: The liberal principle of democracy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority. The liberal model takes a "negative" view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. This is achieved by constitutionally protected civil liberties, strong rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective checks and balances that, together, limit the exercise of executive power. To make this a measure of liberal democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2x_liberal v2x_polyarchy
Data release: 1-13. Release 1, 2, and 3 used a different, preliminary aggregation formula.
Aggregation: The index is aggregated using this formula:
v2x_libdem = .25 * v2x_polyarchy1.585 + .25 * v2x_liberal + .5 * v2x_polyarchy1.585* v2x_liberal

2.1.3	Participatory democracy index (D) (v2x_partipdem)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the ideal of participatory democracy achieved?
Clarification: The participatory principle of democracy emphasizes active participation by citizens in all political processes, electoral and non-electoral. It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies. To make it a measure of participatory democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2x_polyarchy v2x_partip
Data release: 1-13. Release 1-3 used a different, preliminary aggregation formula.
Aggregation: The index is aggregated using this formula:

2.1.4	Deliberative democracy index (D) (v2x_delibdem)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the ideal of deliberative democracy achieved?
Clarification: The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions-as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue
at all levels-from preference formation to final decision-among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. To make it a measure of not only the deliberative principle but also of democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

2.1.5	Egalitarian democracy index (D) (v2x_egaldem)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the ideal of egalitarian democracy achieved?
Clarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate. Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; and 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; 3 groups and individuals enjoy equal access to power. To make it a measure of egalitarian democracy, the index also takes the level of electoral democracy into account.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

2.2 V-Dem Mid-Level Indices: Components of the Democracy Indices
This section includes the V-Dem mid-level indices, subcomponents of the V-Dem Democracy Indices presented in section 2.1. Please see Appendix A for an overview of all indices, component-indices, and lower-level indices.
2.2.1	Additive polyarchy index (D) (v2x_api)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the electoral principle of democracy achieved?
Clarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to achieve responsiveness and accountability between leaders and citizens through the mechanism of competitive elections. This is presumed to be achieved when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and the chief executive of a country is selected directly or indirectly through elections.

Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2x_frassoc_thick v2x_suffr v2xel_frefair v2x_elecoff v2x_freexp_altinf Data release: 6-13.
Aggregation: The index is operationalized by taking the weighted average of the indices measuring freedom of association thick (v2x_frassoc_thick), clean elections (v2xel_frefair), freedom of expression (v2x_freexp_altinf), elected executive (v2x_elecoff), and suffrage (v2x_suffr). The weights are constructed so as to sum to 1 and weigh elected executive and suffrage half as much as the other three, respectively.
The index is aggregated using this formula: v2x_api = (1/4)*v2x_frassoc_thick+(1/4)*v2xel_frefair+(1/4)*v2x_freexp_altinf+ (1/8) * v2x_elecoff + (1/8) * v2x_suffr

Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning, Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent does government respect press and media freedom, the freedom of ordinary people to discuss political matters at home and in the public sphere, as well as the freedom of academic and cultural expression?
Clarification: This index includes all variables in the two indices v2x_freexp and v2xme_altinf.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2mecenefm v2meharjrn v2meslfcen v2xcl_disc v2clacfree v2mebias v2mecrit v2merange

2.2.5	Share of population with suffrage (D) (v2x_suffr)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: What share of adult citizens as defined by statute has the legal right to vote in national elections?
Clarification: This question does not take into consideration restrictions based on age, residence, having been convicted for crime, or being legally incompetent. It covers legal de jure restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice de facto. The adult population as defined by statute is defined by citizens in the case of independent countries or the people living in the territorial entity in the case of colonies. Universal suffrage is coded as 100%. Universal male suffrage only is coded as 50%. Years before electoral provisions are introduced are scored 0%. The scores do not reflect whether an electoral regime was interrupted or not. Only if new constitutions, electoral laws, or the like explicitly introduce new regulations of suffrage, the scores were adjusted accordingly if the changes suggested doing so. If qualifying criteria other than gender apply such as property, tax payments, income, literacy, region, race, ethnicity, religion, and/or 'economic independence', estimates have been calculated by combining information on the restrictions with different kinds of statistical information on population size, age distribution, wealth distribution, literacy rates, size of ethnic groups, etc., secondary country-specific sources, and - in the case of very poor information - the conditions in similar countries or colonies. The scores reflect de jure provisions of suffrage extension in percentage of the adult population. If the suffrage law is revised in a way that affects the extension, the scores reflect this change as of the calendar year the law was enacted.

Since the bulk of these indicators are only observed in election years, the index scores have then been repeated within election regime periods as defined by v2x_elecreg. If a country is recorded as an electoral regime (v2x_elecreg) at the beginning of the time series until the first election that we record, then the scores for this election are backfilled towards the beginning of the time series.

2.2.7	Elected officials index (D) (v2x_elecoff)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: Is the chief executive and legislature appointed through popular elections?
Clarification: This index attempts to measure (a) whether the chief executive is elected, either directly elected through popular elections or indirectly through a popularly elected legislature that then appoints the chief executive; and (b) whether the legislature, in presidential systems with a directly elected president that is also chief executive, is directly or indirectly elected. Note that a popular election is minimally defined and also includes sham elections with limited suffrage and no competition. Similarly, "appointment" by legislature only implies selection and/or approval, not the power to dismiss. This index is useful primarily for aggregating higher-order indices and should not necessarily be interpreted as an important element of democracy in its own right.
Scale: Interval.

Data release: 1-13. 1-3 preliminary aggregation formula, 4-6 as v2x_accex, 7 renamed to v2x_elecoff and modified aggregation, 8.
Aggregation: The index is formed in two steps. First, there are six different chains of appointment/selection to take into account in constructing this index, all of which are scaled to vary from 0 to 1. First, whether the head of state is directly elected (a = 1) or not (a = 0) (from v2ex_elechos). Second, the extent to which the legislature is popularly elected (b). If the legislature is unicameral, b is measured as the proportion of legislators directly elected +
half of the proportion that are indirectly elected. If the legislature is bicameral and the upper house is involved in the appointment of the chief executive, the same proportion of directly and half of the indirectly elected legislators is calculated for the upper house; the scores for the lower and upper houses are then averaged. Third, whether the head of state is appointed by the legislature, or the approval of the legislature is necessary for the appointment of the head of state (c1 = 1, otherwise 0). Fourth, whether the head of government is appointed by the legislature, or the approval of the legislature is necessary for the appointment of the head of government (c2 = 1, otherwise 0). Fifth, whether the head of government is appointed by the head of state (d = 1) or not (d = 0). Sixth, whether the head of government is directly elected (e = 1) or not (e = 0) (from v2ex_elechog).
In the second step, the extent to which the legislature is elected (b) is also independently taken into account in order to penalize presidential systems with unelected legislatures, or legislatures with a large share of presidential appointees, for example.
Define hosw as the weight for the head of state. If the head of state is also head of government (v2exhoshog = 1, hosw = 1). If the head of state has more power than the head of government over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers, then hosw = 1; if the reverse is true, hosw = 0. If they share equal power, hosw = .5. Define the weight for the head of government as hogw = 1 - hosw. The formula then is:
v2x_elecoff = hosw × max(a,b × c1) + hogw × max(a × d,b × c1 × d,e,b × c2),
unless the head of state is directly elected (v2ex_elechos = 1) and the chief executive (v2ex_hosw = 1), in case of which:
v2x_elecoff = [hosw × max(a,b × c1) + hogw × max(a × d,b × c1 × d,e,b × c2) + b]/2)

2.2.8	Liberal component index (D) (v2x_liberal)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the liberal principle of democracy achieved?
Clarification: The liberal principle of democracy emphasizes the importance of protecting individual and minority rights against the tyranny of the state and the tyranny of the majority. The liberal model takes a "negative" view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. This is achieved by constitutionally protected civil liberties, strong rule of law, an independent judiciary, and effective checks and balances that, together, limit the exercise of executive power.

Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the participatory principle achieved?
Clarification: The participatory principle of democracy emphasizes active participation by citizens in all political processes, electoral and non-electoral. It is motivated by uneasiness about a bedrock practice of electoral democracy: delegating authority to representatives. Thus, direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. This model of democracy thus takes suffrage for granted, emphasizing engagement in civil society organizations, direct democracy, and subnational elected bodies.

Question: Are major CSOs routinely consulted by policymakers; how large is the involvement of people in CSOs; are women prevented from participating; and is legislative candidate nomination within party organization highly decentralized or made through party primaries?
Clarification: The sphere of civil society lies in the public space between the private sphere and the state. Here, citizens organize in groups to pursue their collective interests and ideals. We call these groups civil society organizations CSOs. CSOs include, but are by no means limited to, interest groups, labor unions, spiritual organizations if they are engaged in civic or political activities, social movements, professional associations, charities, and other non-governmental organizations.
The core civil society index CCSI is designed to provide a measure of a robust civil society, understood as one that enjoys autonomy from the state and in which citizens freely and actively pursue their political and civic goals, however conceived.

2.2.14	Direct popular vote index (D) (v2xdd_dd)
Project Manager(s): David Altman
Question: To what extent is the direct popular vote utilized?
Clarification: Direct popular voting refers here to an institutionalized process by which citizens of a region or country register their choice or opinion on specific issues through a ballot. It is intended to embrace initiatives, referendums, and plebiscites, as those terms are usually understood. It captures some aspects of the more general concept of direct democracy at the national level. The term does not encompass recall elections, deliberative assemblies, or settings in which the vote is not secret or the purview is restricted. Likewise, it does not apply to elections for representatives.

Data release: 1-13. New aggregation formula in version 7.
Aggregation: This index results from the addition of the weighted scores of each type of popular votes studied (popular initiatives ×1.5, referendums ×1.5, plebiscites, and obligatory referendums). Each type of popular vote receives a maximum score of two resulting from the addition of two terms (easiness of initiation and easiness of approval), where each term obtains a maximum value of one. As we are studying four types of popular votes, the minimum value is 0, and the maximum is 8. In the v2xdd_dd all scores are normalized to range between 0 and 1. For an elaboration of the weighting factor of each component, see:
Altman, David. 2017.
The index is aggregated using this formula:
v2xdd_dd = (v2xdd_i_ci) × 1.5 + (v2xdd_i_rf) × 1.5
+ (v2xdd_i_pl) + (v2xdd_i_or)
Regarding each type of citizen initiated popular vote (i.e., popular initiative), the ease of initiation is measured by (a) the existence of a direct democracy process (v2ddlexci), (b) the number of signatures needed (v2ddsigpci), and (c) time-limits to circulate the signatures (v2ddsigdci). Easiness of approval is measured by the surface of the polygon determined by (a) participation quorum (v2ddsigdci), (b) approval quorum (v2ddpartci), and (c) supermajority (v2ddspmci). The resulting score is then multiplied with (d) district majority (v2ddadmci). Consequences are measured by (a) the legal status of the decision made by citizens (binding or merely consultative) (v2ddlexci), and (b) the frequency and degree of success with which direct popular votes have been held in the past (v2ddthreci). The index is aggregated using this formula:
v2xdd_dd = [(IF v2ddlexci > 0,1,0) × (1 - (v2ddsigpci)) × (IF v2ddsigdci
= 0,1,.5 + (2 × v2ddsigdci/365))+
(v2ddsigdci) n (v2ddpartci) n (v2ddspmci)]
× (0.5 + ((100 - v2ddadmci)/100))/2]
× (IF v2ddlexci = 2,1,IF v2ddlexci = 1,0.75,v2ddlexci = 0,0)
× (IF years since last successful event < 6,
v2ddthreci = 1,afterwards decreases by 0.06 units per year
until 0.1; if the event was not successful
during the first years v2ddapprci
= 0.9,afterwards decreases by 0.1 units per year until 0.1)
    In case the vote originates from above (i.e., authorities), there is no need to account for v2ddsigpci and v2ddsigdci. For an elaboration of the interaction among quorums, (v2ddsigdci) n (v2ddpartci) n (v2ddspmci), see Altman, David. 2017. Country-Year Aggregation: Last

Question: Are there elected local governments, and - if so - to what extent can they operate without interference from unelected bodies at the local level?
Clarification: The lowest score would be reserved for a country that has no elected local governments. A medium score would be accorded a country that has elected local governments but where those governments are subordinate to unelected officials at the local level perhaps appointed by a higher-level body. A high score would be accorded to a country in which local governments are elected and able to operate without restrictions from unelected actors at the local level with the exception of judicial bodies. Naturally, local governments remain subordinate to the regional and national governments.

2.2.17	Deliberative component index (D) (v2xdl_delib)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the deliberative principle of democracy achieved?
Clarification: The deliberative principle of democracy focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions-as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. According to this principle, democracy requires more than an aggregation of existing preferences. There should also be respectful dialogue at all levels-from preference formation to final decision-among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion.
To measure these features of a polity we try to determine the extent to which political elites give public justifications for their positions on matters of public policy, justify their positions in terms of the public good, acknowledge and respect counter-arguments; and how wide the range of consultation is at elite levels.

Clarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy holds that material and immaterial inequalities inhibit the exercise of formal rights and liberties, and diminish the ability of citizens from all social groups to participate. Egalitarian democracy is achieved when 1 rights and freedoms of individuals are protected equally across all social groups; 2 resources are distributed equally across all social groups; and 3 access to power is equally distributed by gender, socioeconomic class and social group.

Question: How equal is the protection of rights and freedoms across social groups by the state?
Clarification: Equal protection means that the state grants and protects rights and freedoms evenly across social groups. To achieve equal protection of rights and freedoms, the state itself must not interfere in the ability of groups to participate and it must also take action to ensure that rights and freedoms of one social group are not threatened by the actions of another group or individual.

Clarification: This component measures the extent to which resources - both tangible and intangible - are distributed in society. An equal distribution of resources supports egalitarian democracy in two ways. First, lower poverty rates and the distribution of goods and services such as food, water, housing, education and healthcare ensure that all individuals are capable of participating in politics and government. In short, basic needs must be met in order for individuals to effectively exercise their rights and freedoms see, for example, Sen 1999, Maslow 1943. Second, high levels of resource inequality undermine the ability of poorer populations to participate meaningfully Aristotle, Dahl 2006. Thus, it is necessary to include not only measures of poverty and the distribution of goods and services, but also the levels of inequality in these distributions, and the proportion of the population who are not eligible for social services i.e. means-tests, particularistic distribution, etc.. This principle also implies that social or economic inequalities can translate into political inequalities, an issue addressed most notably by Walzer 1983, who argues that overlapping "spheres" of inequality are particularly harmful to society. To address these overlapping "spheres", this component also includes measures of the distribution of power in society amongst different socio-economic groups, genders, etc.

3 V-Dem Indicators
This section lists all V-Dem variables by theme.
3.1 Elections
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Elections: Among national elections we distinguish elections to: (i) the lower or unicameral chamber of the legislature (including constituent or constitutional assemblies), (ii) the upper chamber of the legislature, and (iii) the presidency. For present purposes an executive who is elected by a legislature is considered a prime minister, not a president. In order to be considered a president, an executive must, under ordinary circumstances, be chosen directly by the electorate (perhaps mediated by an electoral college).
Non-election specific coding: The following questions are not election-specific and should be coded for every year from 1900 (or when applicable) to the present.
Election specific questions: The following questions pertain to specific national elections. The date of each election is pre-coded. In cases where more than one election is held on the same day(s), the questions in this section are for all elections taking place on that date. If you have coded for V-Dem in the past, your previous scores will be displayed in the survey. You are welcome to revise previously submitted scores in all surveys. For this section, we kindly ask you make sure that you have coded all election years.
Election specific questions - Historical clarification: The following questions pertain to specific national elections. National elections include elections to the presidency (if applicable) and legislature (lower and upper house, whatever applies), whether direct or indirect, as well as constituent assembly elections. It does not include other elections, e.g., subnational elections, plebiscites, initiatives, referendums, or by-elections. The date of each election is pre-coded. In cases where more than one election is held on the same day(s), the questions in this section are for all elections taking place on that date."
Subnational elections and offices: This section of the survey asks a small number of questions about subnational elections and offices. You will be instructed to identify two subnational levels, referred to as "regional government" and "local government". Questions in this section should be answered for every year, rather than for specific elections.
Lower chamber election: The following questions pertain to specific lower chamber or unicameral legislative elections. The dates of these elections have been pre-coded.
Executive and legislative versions of Election specific variables

• In order to subset election specific variables for executive elections only (previously *_ex) - keep only those observations where v2xel_elecpres is 1.
• In order to subset election specific variables for legislative elections only (previously *_leg) - keep only those observations where v2xel_elecparl is 1.
3.1.0.1	Election type (A*) (v2eltype)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Question: What type of election was held on this date?
Clarification: Choose all that apply. Whenever possible, specify the exact date of each election. If the election unfolds across more than one day, enter the date for the first day. If the precise date is unavailable, enter the first of the month; if the month is unknown, enter January 1.
Multiple-round elections (e.g., two-round elections) are counted separately. (More than one election in a single year can be accommodated.)
Responses:
0: Legislative; lower, sole, or both chambers, first or only round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_0] 1: Legislative, lower, sole, or both chambers, second round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_1] 2: Legislative, upper chamber only, first or only round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_2] (Not yet coded)
3: Legislative, upper chamber only, second round.	(0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_3] (Not yet coded)
4: Constituent Assembly, first or only round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_4]
5: Constituent Assembly, second round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_5]
6: Presidential, first or only round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_6]
7: Presidential, second round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_7]
8: Metropolitan or supranational legislative, first or only round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_8] (Not yet coded)
9: Metropolitan or supranational legislative, second round. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2eltype_9] (Not yet coded)

Notes: All direct elections and elections by an electoral college that is elected by the people and has the sole purpose of electing an executive or members of parliament are coded. Note that single-party elections, elections held under limited suffrage and for only parts of a parliament, as well as elections of which the results are subsequently cancelled are included. Elections for constituent assemblies that come to perform functions beyond drafting and adopting a new constitution (e.g. legislating, electing president, adopting budget, etc) are also included and coded under category 0 and 1 (Legislative; lower, sole, or both chambers; first or second round). Excluded are elections that are not decisive, i. e. when the HOS alone is selecting the candidate(s). The variable includes elections where results were declared invalid after the fact, e.g. by a constitutional court, since they also provide information on the quality of democracy.

3.1.1	Suffrage
3.1.1.1	Suffrage (A) (v2asuffrage)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Question: What is the approximate percentage of enfranchised adults older than the minimal voting age?
Clarification: This question does not take into consideration restrictions based on age, residence, having been convicted for crime, being in the military service or being legally incompetent. This variable, in contrast to v2elsuffrage, covers de facto enfranchised adults and not de jure. For example, the scores reflect whether an electoral regime was interrupted or not. If an electoral regime is interrupted (see v2x_elecreg), v2asuffrage is zero while v2elsuffrage may still be 100.
The adult population (as defined by statute) is defined by citizens in the case of independent countries or the people living in the territorial entity in the case of colonies.

Project Manager(s): Megan Reif
Question: What is the level of suffrage practiced?
Clarification: Note that this question applies to citizens only. Note also that we are interested in legal (de jure) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (de facto). In cases where married people are allowed to vote at a younger age than single people, the higher (older) age minimum for single voters is given (see v2elage).

3.1.1.6	Percentage of population with suffrage (A) (v2elsuffrage)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: What percentage (%) of adult citizens (as defined by statute) has the legal right to vote in national elections?
Clarification: This question does not take into consideration restrictions based on age, residence, having been convicted for crime, being in the military service or being legally incompetent. It covers legal (de jure) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (de facto). The adult population (as defined by statute) is defined by citizens in the case of independent countries or the people living in the territorial entity in the case of colonies.
Universal suffrage is coded as 100%. Universal male suffrage is only coded as 50%. Years before electoral provisions are introduced are scored 0%. The scores do not reflect whether an electoral regime was interrupted or not. Only if new constitutions, electoral laws, or the like explicitly introduce new regulations of suffrage, the scores were adjusted accordingly if the changes suggested doing so. If qualifying criteria other than gender apply (such as property, tax payments, income, literacy, region, race, ethnicity, religion, and/or 'economic independence'), estimates have been calculated by combining information on the restrictions with different kinds of statistical information (on population size, age distribution, wealth distribution, literacy rates, size of ethnic groups, etc.), secondary country-specific sources, and - in the case of very poor information - the conditions in similar countries or colonies.
The scores reflect de jure provisions of suffrage extension in percentage of the adult population. If the suffrage law is revised in a way that affects the extension, the scores reflect this change as of the calendar year the law was enacted.

Percent.

Question: Does the Election Management Body (EMB) have autonomy from government to apply election laws and administrative rules impartially in national elections?
Clarification: The EMB refers to whatever body (or bodies) is charged with administering national elections.
Responses:
0: No. The EMB is controlled by the incumbent government, the military, or other de facto ruling body.
1: Somewhat. The EMB has some autonomy on some issues but on critical issues that influence the outcome of elections, the EMB is partial to the de facto ruling body.
2: Ambiguous. The EMB has some autonomy but is also partial, and it is unclear to what extent this influences the outcome of the election.
3: Almost. The EMB has autonomy and acts impartially almost all the time. It may be influenced by the de facto ruling body in some minor ways that do not influence the outcome of elections.
4: Yes. The EMB is autonomous and impartially applies elections laws and administrative rules.

Question: Does the Election Management Body (EMB) have sufficient staff and resources to administer a well-run national election?
Clarification: The EMB refers to whatever body (or bodies) is charged with administering national elections.
Responses:
0: No. There are glaring deficits in staff, financial, or other resources affecting the organization across the territory.
1: Not really. Deficits are not glaring but they nonetheless seriously compromised the organization of administratively well-run elections in many parts of the country.
2: Ambiguous. There might be serious deficiencies compromising the organization of the election but it could also be a product of human errors and co-incidence or other factors outside the control of the EMB.
3: Mostly. There are partial deficits in resources but these are neither serious nor widespread. 4: Yes. The EMB has adequate staff and other resources to administer a well-run election.

Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Was this national election multiparty?
Responses:
0: No. No-party or single-party and there is no meaningful competition (includes situations where a few parties are legal but they are all de facto controlled by the dominant party). 1: Not really. No-party or single-party (defined as above) but multiple candidates from the same party and/or independents contest legislative seats or the presidency.
2: Constrained. At least one real opposition party is allowed to contest but competition is highly constrained - legally or informally.
3: Almost. Elections are multiparty in principle but either one main opposition party is prevented (de jure or de facto) from contesting, or conditions such as civil unrest (excluding natural disasters) prevent competition in a portion of the territory.
4: Yes. Elections are multiparty, even though a few marginal parties may not be permitted to contest (e.g. far-right/left extremist parties, anti-democratic religious or ethnic parties).

3.1.2.6	Election voter registry (C) (v2elrgstry)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this national election, was there a reasonably accurate voter registry in place and was it used?
Responses:
0: No. There was no registry, or the registry was not used.
1: No. There was a registry but it was fundamentally flawed (meaning 20% or more of eligible voters could have been disenfranchised or the outcome could have been affected significantly by double-voting and impersonation).
2: Uncertain. There was a registry but it is unclear whether potential flaws in the registry had much impact on electoral outcomes.
3: Yes, somewhat. The registry was imperfect but less than 10% of eligible voters may have been disenfranchised, and double-voting and impersonation could not have affected the results significantly.
4: Yes. The voter registry was reasonably accurate (less than 1% of voters were affected by any flaws) and it was applied in a reasonable fashion.

3.1.2.7	Election vote buying (C) (v2elvotbuy)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this national election, was there evidence of vote and/or turnout buying?
Clarification: Vote and turnout buying refers to the distribution of money or gifts to individuals, families, or small groups in order to influence their decision to vote/not vote or whom to vote for. It does not include legislation targeted at specific constituencies, i.e., "porkbarrel" legislation.
Responses:
0: Yes. There was systematic, widespread, and almost nationwide vote/turnout buying by almost all parties and candidates.
1: Yes, some. There were non-systematic but rather common vote-buying efforts, even if only in some parts of the country or by one or a few parties.
2: Restricted. Money and/or personal gifts were distributed by parties or candidates but these offerings were more about meeting an 'entry-ticket' expectation and less about actual vote choice or turnout, even if a smaller number of individuals may also be persuaded.
3: Almost none. There was limited use of money and personal gifts, or these attempts were limited to a few small areas of the country. In all, they probably affected less than a few percent of voters.
4: None. There was no evidence of vote/turnout buying.

Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this national election, was there evidence of other intentional irregularities by incumbent and/or opposition parties, and/or vote fraud?
Clarification: Examples include use of double IDs, intentional lack of voting materials, ballotstuffing, misreporting of votes, and false collation of votes. This question does not refer to lack of access to registration, harassment of opposition parties, manipulations of the voter registry or vote-buying (dealt with in previous questions).
Responses:
0: Yes. There were systematic and almost nationwide other irregularities.
1: Yes, some. There were non-systematic, but rather common other irregularities, even if only in some parts of the country.
2: Sporadic. There were a limited number of sporadic other irregularities, and it is not clear whether they were intentional or disfavored particular groups.
3: Almost none. There were only a limited number of irregularities, and many were probably unintentional or did not disfavor particular groups' access to participation.
4: None. There was no evidence of intentional other irregularities. Unintentional irregularities resulting from human error and/or natural conditions may still have occurred.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this national election, were opposition candidates/parties/campaign workers subjected to repression, intimidation, violence, or harassment by the government, the ruling party, or their agents?
Clarification: Other types of clearly distinguishable civil violence, even if politically motivated, during the election period should not be factored in when scoring this indicator (it is dealt with separately).
Responses:
0: Yes. The repression and intimidation by the government or its agents was so strong that the entire period was quiet.
1: Yes, frequent: There was systematic, frequent and violent harassment and intimidation of the opposition by the government or its agents during the election period.
2: Yes, some. There was periodic, not systematic, but possibly centrally coordinated - harassment and intimidation of the opposition by the government or its agents.
3: Restrained. There were sporadic instances of violent harassment and intimidation by the government or its agents, in at least one part of the country, and directed at only one or two local branches of opposition groups.
    4: None. There was no harassment or intimidation of opposition by the government or its agents, during the election campaign period and polling day. Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.

Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this national election, was the campaign period, election day, and post-election process free from other types (not by the government, the ruling party, or their agents) of violence related to the conduct of the election and the campaigns (but not conducted by the government and its agents)?
Responses:
0: No. There was widespread violence between civilians occurring throughout the election period, or in an intense period of more than a week and in large swaths of the country. It resulted in a large number of deaths or displaced refugees.
1: Not really. There were significant levels of violence but not throughout the election period or beyond limited parts of the country. A few people may have died as a result, and some people may have been forced to move temporarily.
2: Somewhat. There were some outbursts of limited violence for a day or two, and only in a small part of the country. The number of injured and otherwise affected was relatively small. 3: Almost. There were only a few instances of isolated violent acts, involving only a few people; no one died and very few were injured.
4: Peaceful. No election-related violence between civilians occurred.

Responses:
0: Total. All opposition parties and candidates boycotted the election.
1: Significant. Some but not all opposition parties or candidates boycotted but they constituted a major opposition force.
2: Ambiguous. Some but not all opposition parties or candidates boycotted but it is unclear whether they would have constituted a major electoral force.

3.1.2.15	Election free and fair (C) (v2elfrfair)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Taking all aspects of the pre-election period, election day, and the post-election process into account, would you consider this national election to be free and fair?
Clarification: The only thing that should not be considered in coding this is the extent of suffrage (by law). Thus, a free and fair election may occur even if the law excludes significant groups (an issue measured separately).
Responses:
0: No, not at all. The elections were fundamentally flawed and the official results had little if anything to do with the 'will of the people' (i.e., who became president; or who won the legislative majority).
1: Not really. While the elections allowed for some competition, the irregularities in the end affected the outcome of the election (i.e., who became president; or who won the legislative majority).
2: Ambiguous. There was substantial competition and freedom of participation but there were also significant irregularities. It is hard to determine whether the irregularities affected the outcome or not (as defined above).
3: Yes, somewhat. There were deficiencies and some degree of fraud and irregularities but these did not in the end affect the outcome (as defined above).
4: Yes. There was some amount of human error and logistical restrictions but these were largely unintentional and without significant consequences.

Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton
Question: In this national election, what percentage (%) of the adult voting-age population cast a vote according to official results?
Clarification: The VAP can reflect irregularities such as problems with the voters' register or registration system. VAP numbers are estimates since they do not take into account legal or systemic barriers to the exercise of the franchise or account for non-eligible members of the population. Thus, it can occur that VAP values surpass 100 which is not an error but reflects such conditions.
Responses:
Percent.
Scale: Interval.

3.1.4.5	Election HOG turnover ordinal (A) (v2elturnhog)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Question: Was there turnover in the office of the head of government (HOG) as a result of this national election?
Clarification: Turnover can occur in presidential, semi-presidential, as well as parliamentary systems, and it refers not only to the individual person holding office but also to that person's party. If the HOS and HOG are the same person, the coding is the same for the two variables. The second round of election is coded as the first.
Responses:
0: No. The head of government- retained his/her position either as a result of the outcome of the election, or because the elections do not affect the HOG.
1: Half. The head of government is a different individual than before the election but from the same party that was in power before the election, or a new independent candidate is elected. In parliamentary systems this code applies when the head of government changes as an effect of alternations in the ruling coalition, changes in party leadership.
2: Yes. The executive(s) - head of state and head of government- lost their position(s) as a result of the outcome of the election. In presidential systems this code applies when the new president is both a different person and from a different party than before the election or an independent candidate is elected. In parliamentary systems the ruling party or coalition of parties lost and the new head of government is from a different party or from a new coalition. This code also applies if this is the first head of government elected for a newly (semi-) independent state country.

3.1.4.7	Election executive turnover ordinal (A) (v2eltvrexo)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg
Question: Was there turnover in the executive office as a result of this national election?
Clarification: Turnover in the executive can occur in presidential, semi-presidential, as well as parliamentary systems, and it refers not only to the individual person holding office but also to that person's party. This question considers whether turnover occurs both in the office of head of state and head of government, even if one of the positions is not contested in the particular elections.
Responses:
0: No. The executive(s) - head of state and head of government - retained their position either as a result of the outcome of the election, or because the elections do not affect the executive.
1: Half. The head of state or head of government is a different individual than before the election but from the same party (or independent) that was in power before the election. In parliamentary systems this code applies when the head of government changes as an effect of alternations in the ruling coalition, changes in party leadership, or a new independent head of government. In semi-presidential regimes, this code applies when the elections result in co-habitation after a period when one party (or independent) has held both offices, or if one of the executive office holders - the head of state or head of government changes, while the other retains their position.
2: Yes. The executive(s) - head of state and head of government - lost their position(s) as a result of the outcome of the election. In presidential systems this code applies when the new president is both a different person and from a different party (or independent) than before the election. In parliamentary systems the ruling party or coalition of parties lost and the new head of government is from a different party or from a new coalition. In semi-presidential regimes, this code applies when one party holds both the office of the head of state and head of government after a period of co-habitation, or if the holders of both offices change in terms of person and party (or independent) in the same election. This code also applies if this is the first head of state and/or head of government elected for a newly (semi-) independent state country.

3.1.5.4	Lower chamber electoral system - 13 categories (A) (v2elloelsy)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg, Carl Henrik Knutsen, Jan Teorell
Question: What was the electoral system used in this election for the lower or unicameral chamber of the legislature?
Clarification: Mixed majoritarian systems were coded as a two-round system. Regarding multi-member districts we coded list PR with large multi-member districts when the mean district size = 7. Constituent Assembly elections are excluded from the coding, since they often use specifically designed electoral systems. Further information on the following electoral system types can be found in Reynolds/Reilly, The New International IDEA Handbook (2005), chapter two and Annex B (Glossary of Terms) - downloadable, free of charge, at www.idea.int/publications/esd/.
Responses:
0: First-past-the-post (FPP, aka plurality) in single-member constituencies. The candidate with the most votes wins the seat.
1: Two-round system in single-member constituencies. Like FPP except that a threshold - usually 50% + 1 - is required to avoid a runoff between the two top vote-getters.
2: Alternative vote in single-member districts. Voters rank-order their preferences for the candidates who compete for a single seat. If any candidate receives an absolute majority of first preferences, s/he is elected.
If not, then the least successful candidates (based on first-preferences) are eliminated and
their votes reallocated to the second-preferences. This process is repeated until a candidate reaches 50% +1 of the votes.
3: Block vote in multi-member districts. Electors have as many votes as there are seats within that district and can rank-order them (within or across parties) as they please.
4: Party block vote in multi-member districts. Voters cast a vote for a single party (but not for individual candidates within the party's list). The party with the most votes (i.e., a plurality) wins all the seats in that district.
5: Parallel (SMD/PR). Some seats are in single-member districts (allocated by FPP or two-round electoral rules) and other seats are in multimember districts (allocated by some form of PR). These districts are overlapping, meaning that each elector votes twice: once in the single-member district race and once in the multi-member district race. Results are independent.
6: Mixed-member proportional (SMD with PR compensatory seats). Some seats are in single-member districts (allocated by FPP or two-round electoral rules) and other seats are in multimember districts (allocated by some form of PR). These districts are overlapping, meaning that each elector votes twice: once in the single-member district race and once in the multi-member district race. Results are not independent. Specifically, the multimember seats are used to rectify disproportionalities achieved in the single-member district election - by adding seats, as necessary.
This means that the representation of parties in the legislature is determined entirely by the PR ballot. It also means that the result of an MMP election is similar to the result of a PR election: parties achieve representation according to their nationwide vote share (on the PR ballot).
7: List PR with small multi-member districts (mean district size < 7). Each party presents a list of candidates for election within a district. Electors vote for a party, and parties receive seats in (rough) proportion to their overall share of the vote. Mean district size is less than seven.
8: List PR with large multi-member districts (mean district size > 7). Each party presents a list of candidates for election within a district. Electors vote for a party, and parties receive seats in (rough) proportion to their overall share of the vote. Mean district size is greater than seven.
9: Single-transferable vote (STV) in multi-member districts. Electors rank-order candidates nominated for a district. Candidates that surpass a specified quota of first-preference votes are elected. The remaining seats are chosen by reallocating the votes of the least successful candidates to elector's second- (or third-) preferences until the specified quota is reached. This process is repeated until all seats for that district are filled.
10: Single non-transferable vote (SNTV) in multi-member districts. Each elector chooses a single candidate. The candidates with the most votes (a plurality) win. (The number of winners is of course determined by the size of the district.) 11: Limited vote in multi-member districts.
Electors have more than one vote but fewer votes than the number of seats in the district. The candidates with the most votes (a plurality) win. (The number of winners is of course determined by the size of the district.)
12: Borda Count in single- or multi-member districts. Electors use numbers to mark preferences among candidates and each preference is assigned a value. For example, in a ten-candidate field a first preference is worth one, a second preference is worth .9, and so forth. These are summed and the candidate(s) with the highest total(s) is/are elected.

Responses:
0: No. The majority party or ruling coalition includes the same or substantially the same parties, even if some minor parties (holding less than 10 % of the seats in the legislature) left or joined the coalition, or because the elections do not affect the lower chamber.
1: Half. A minority party or coalition who was not in control of the chamber before the elections assumed the leading position in the legislature but is dependent on other parties for support. Or, a post-election ruling coalition includes some old parties and some new parties and the new parties represent more than 10 % of the seats in the legislature.
2: Yes. The incumbent party or coalition lost its majority or plurality-dominant position in the legislature and a different party or coalition assumes the majority position.

3.1.6	Subnational
3.1.6.1	Regional government exists (A,C) (v2elreggov)
Project Manager(s): Kelly McMann
Question: Is there a regional government?
Clarification: Regional government is typically the second-highest level of government, just below the national government. There are many names for units at this level; some common ones are regions, provinces, states, departments, and cantons.
Countries with more than two subnational levels may have multiple levels that fit the definition of regional government. If this is the case, for all questions about regional government please code the regional level that, in practice, has the most responsibilities (e.g. making laws, providing primary, education, maintaining roads, policing, etc.) and resources to carry out those responsibilities.
Some countries are so small that, now or in earlier time periods, they have only local government and not regional government. If this is the case, please code this question as "0" for the appropriate time period.
If you have questions about identifying the regional government for your country, please send an email inquiry to your V-Dem contact.

3.1.6.3	Regional government elected (A,C) (v2elsrgel)
Project Manager(s): Kelly McMann
Question: At the regional level, are government offices elected in practice?
Clarification: "Government offices" here refers to a regional executive and a regional assembly, not a judiciary and not minor bureaucrats. An executive is a single individual (or a very small group) (e.g., a governor). An assembly is a larger body of officials, who may be divided into two chambers.
"Elected" refers to offices that are directly elected by citizens or indirectly elected by a regional elected assembly. All other methods of obtaining office - including appointment by higher or lower levels of government - are considered to be non-elected.
In classifying a position as elected one is making no judgments about the freeness/fairness of the election or the relative extent of suffrage. One is simply indicating that there is an election and that the winner of that election (however conducted) generally takes office.
Responses:
0: Generally, offices at the regional level are not elected.
1: Generally, the regional executive is elected but not the assembly.
2: Generally, the regional assembly is elected but not the executive.
3: Generally, the regional executive is elected and there is no assembly.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How would you characterize the relative power, in practice, of elected and non-elected offices at the regional level?
Clarification: We are concerned with the relative power of regional offices to each other, not the power of regional offices relative to higher or lower levels of government.
Please consider only major offices, such as the executive, assembly, and judiciary, not those of minor bureaucrats. (A body of government officials, such as an assembly or judiciary, counts as one office.)
An office is "subordinate" if its officeholders can be chosen and removed by another office or if its decisions can be blocked or modified by another office, but it cannot similarly constrain the other office.
Responses:
0: All or nearly all elected offices are subordinate to non-elected offices at the regional level.
1: Some elected offices are subordinate to non-elected offices at the regional level.
2: Elected and non-elected offices are approximately equal in power at the regional level.
3: Most non-elected offices are subordinate to elected offices at the regional level.

3.1.6.5	Local government exists (A,C) (v2ellocgov)

Question: Is there a local government?
Clarification: Local government refers to the level of government below the regional government. There are many names for units at this level; some common ones are counties, communes, cities, municipalities, towns, rural municipalities, and villages.
Countries with more than two subnational levels may have multiple levels that fit the definition of local government. If this is the case, please code the local level that, in practice, has the most responsibilities (e.g. making laws, providing primary, education, maintaining roads, policing, etc.) and resources to carry out those responsibilities.

3.1.6.8	Local offices relative power (C) (v2ellocpwr)
Project Manager(s): Kelly McMann
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How would you characterize the relative power, in practice, of elected and non-elected offices at the local level?
Clarification: We are concerned with the relative power of local offices to each other, not the power of local offices relative to higher levels of government.
Please consider only major offices, such as the executive, assembly, and judiciary, not those of minor bureaucrats. (A body of government officials, such as an assembly or judiciary, counts as one office.)
An office is "subordinate" if its officeholders can be chosen and removed by another office or if its decisions can be blocked or modified by another office, but it cannot similarly constrain the other office.
Responses:
0: All or nearly all elected offices are subordinate to non-elected offices at the local level.
1: Some elected offices are subordinate to non-elected offices at the local level.
2: Elected and non-elected offices are approximately equal in power at the local level.
3: Most non-elected offices are subordinate to elected offices at the local level.
4: All or nearly all non-elected offices are subordinate to elected offices at the local level.

3.1.6.9	Subnational elections free and fair (C) (v2elffelr)
Project Manager(s): Kelly McMann
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Taking all aspects of the pre-election period, election day, and the post-election process into account, would you consider subnational elections (regional and local, as previously identified) to be free and fair on average?
Clarification: This question refers to subnational levels that have elected offices and elections. It does not refer to subnational levels without elected offices and elections. If there were no subnational elections in any of the years covered in this survey, choose option 5.
"Free and fair" refers to all aspects of the election process except the extent of suffrage (by law). Thus, a free and fair election may occur even if the law excludes significant groups (we measure that issue separately).
Responses:
0: No, not at all. The elections were fundamentally flawed and the official results had little if anything to do with the 'will of the people' (who won office).
1: Not really. While the elections allowed for some competition, the irregularities in the end affected the outcome of the elections (who won office).
2: Ambiguous. There was substantial competition and freedom of participation but there were also significant irregularities. It is hard to determine whether the irregularities affected the outcome or not (who won office).
3: Yes, somewhat. There were deficiencies and some degree of fraud and irregularities but these did not in the end affect the outcome (who won office).
4: Yes. There was some amount of human error and logistical restrictions but these were largely unintentional and without significant consequences.
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: As of December 2014, the former category "5" is recoded as a separate variable (v2elffelrbin). Data release: 3-13.

3.1.6.10	Subnational elections held (C) (v2elffelrbin)
Project Manager(s): Kelly McMann
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Are subnational elections held?
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes.
Scale: Dichotomous, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: As of December 2014, the former category "5" from variable v2elffelr is recoded as a separate variable (v2elffelrbin). If a coder chose the 5th category in the original question, it receives 0 in the new "v2elffelrbin" variable (corresponding to the answer, no, there were no subnational elections); otherwise it receives 1 (yes, there are subnational elections held). The resulting series of 0-1 country-coder time-series is run in the measurement model, which calculates the final value of v2elffelrbin while taking into account background coder characteristics.

Question: Does the freeness and fairness of subnational elections vary across different areas of the country?
Clarification: Subnational elections refer to elections to regional or local offices, as specified above.
Responses:
0: Yes. Subnational elections in some areas of the country are significantly more free and fair (or, alternatively, significantly less free and fair) than subnational elections in other areas of the country.
1: Somewhat. Subnational elections in some areas of the country are somewhat more free and fair (or, alternatively, somewhat less free and fair) than subnational elections in other areas of the country.
2: No. Subnational elections in most or all areas of the country are equally free and fair (or, alternatively, equally not free and not fair).

3.2 Political Parties
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Political parties: A "political party" refers to an organization that nominates candidates for public office. A party may refer to a longstanding coalition such as the CDU/CSU in Germany if that coalition functions in most respects like a single party. Sometimes, the identity of a party is obscured by name changes. However, if the party/coalition changes names but retains key personnel and is still run by and for the same constituency then it should be considered the same organization. Our notion of a party includes loose factional groupings such as the Tories and Whigs in the 19th-century Britain or the Caps and Hats in 18th-century Sweden. Unless stated otherwise the following questions pertain to parties that compete for seats in the national legislature or for the presidency.
Most of the questions in the following section ask you to generalize across parties in a particular country (and at a particular point in time). We realize that practices vary from party to party; these are, after all, highly diverse organizations. However, for our purposes it is important to consider what the most common practices are.
In answering these questions it is sometimes important to distinguish between formal rules (as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent) and actual practice (what happens on the ground). In order to clarify the de jure/de facto distinction, we employ the terms "by law..." and "in practice..." Please pay close attention to these cues wherever you see them. And if there is no clarification of the issue, assume that the question is referring to practices rather than formal rules.

Project Manager(s): Allen Hicken
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: How restrictive are the barriers to forming a party?
Clarification: Barriers include legal requirements such as requirements for membership or financial deposits, as well as harassment.
Responses:
0: Parties are not allowed.
1: It is impossible, or virtually impossible, for parties not affiliated with the government to form (legally).
2: There are significant obstacles (e.g. party leaders face high levels of regular political harassment by authorities).
3: There are modest barriers (e.g.	party leaders face occasional political harassment by authorities).
4: There are no substantial barriers.
Ordering: If your answer is 1-4, proceed to the next question [v2psoppaut]. If your answer is 0, skip to the question about Party organization [v2psorgs].

Question: How many political parties with representation in the national legislature or presidency have publicly available party platforms (manifestos) that are publicized and relatively distinct from one another?
Clarification: In order to be counted in the affirmative, parties must have platforms that are both distinct (either in terms of content or generalized ideology) and publicly disseminated. This question is not intended to measure how much the public actually knows about these platforms or whether they are important in structuring policymaking.
Responses:
0: None, or nearly none.
1: Fewer than half.
2: About half.
3: More than half.
4: All, or nearly all.

Project Manager(s): Allen Hicken
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: How centralized is legislative candidate selection within the parties?
Clarification: The power to select candidates for national legislative elections is often divided between local/municipal party actors, regional/state-level party organizations, and national party leaders. One level usually dominates the selection process, while sometimes candidate selection is the outcome of bargaining between the different levels of party organization.
Responses:
0: National legislative candidates are selected exclusively by national party leaders. 1: National legislative candidate selection is dominated by national party leaders but with some limited influence from local or state level organizations.
2: National legislative candidates are chosen through bargaining across different levels of party organization.
3: National legislative candidates are chosen by regional or state-level organizations, perhaps with some input from local party organizations or constituency groups.
4: National legislative candidates are chosen by a small cadre of local or municipal level actors. 5: National legislative candidates are chosen by constituency groups or direct primaries.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is it normal for members of the legislature to vote with other members of their party on important bills?
Responses:
0: Not really. Many members are elected as independents and party discipline is very weak. 1: More often than not. Members are more likely to vote with their parties than against them, but defections are common.
2: Mostly. Members vote with their parties most of the time.
3: Yes, absolutely. Members vote with their parties almost all the time.

Question: Which of the following best describes the nature of electoral support for major parties (those gaining over 10 % of the vote)?
Clarification: Leave this question blank if election was nonpartisan, i.e., no parties (not even pro-government parties) were allowed.
Responses:
0: Most major parties are competitive in only one or two regions of the country, i.e., their support is heavily concentrated in a few areas.
1: Most major parties are competitive in some regions of the country, but not in others. 2: Most major parties are competitive in most regions of the country.

3.2.0.12	National party control (C) (v2psnatpar)
Project Manager(s): Allen Hicken
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: How unified is party control of the national government?
Clarification: With respect to the executive, consider only those offices that have effective power over policymaking. (If there is a monarch or president with very little policymaking power, this office should not be considered.) With respect to bicameral legislatures, consider only the chamber, or chambers, that have effective policymaking power. (If the upper chamber is inactive or clearly subordinate, consider only the lower chamber.) Leave this question blank if election was nonpartisan, i.e., no parties (not even pro-government parties) were allowed.
Responses:
0: Unified coalition control. A single multi-party coalition controls the executive and legislative branches of the national government. (This is true almost by definition in a parliamentary system where a single coalition gathers together a majority of seats.). 1: Divided party control. (A) Different parties or individuals (unconnected to parties) control the executive and the legislature or (B) Executive power is divided between a president/monarch and a prime minister, each of which belongs to different parties; or between a non-partisan monarch and a prime minister.
2: Unified party control. A single party controls the executive and legislative branches of the national government. (This is true almost by definition in a parliamentary system where a single party has a majority of seats.).

3.3 Direct Democracy
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Direct democracy: This set of questions focuses on direct popular votes. Four mechanisms are distinguished:
a. Measures placed on the ballot by the executive and/or the legislature for which the constitutionor basic laws require a vote. These are referred to as constitutional referendums (i.e. obligatory referendums).
b. Measures placed on the ballot by the executive and/or the legislature that for which the constitution or basic laws does not require a vote. These are referred to as plebiscites.
c. Measures placed on the ballot through a citizen petition process that concern the possible adoption of a new law or constitutional amendment. These are referred to as popular initiatives.
d. Measures placed on the ballot through a citizen petition process that concern the possible rejection of a recently approved law or a bill discussed in parliament. These are referred to as referendums.
Note that we do not consider recall elections or citizen petitions to the legislature even they may also involve a gathering of signatures or a popular vote. Note also that in coding these questions it is sometimes important to distinguish between formal rules (as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent) and actual practice. In order to clarify the de jure/de facto distinction, we employ the terms "by law..." and "in practice..."
3.3.1	Initiatives

3.4 The Executive
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Executive: In this section, we distinguish between the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG). The head of state is an individual or collective body that serves as the chief public representative of the country. Sometimes this is a largely ceremonial role, e.g. a monarch who reigns but does not rule, or a president whose powers are strictly circumscribed. The head of government is the chief officer(s) of the executive branch of government, typically presiding over a cabinet. In a parliamentary system, this is usually the prime minister. In a presidential system, this is usually the president, who then serves as both, head of state and head of government. In a typical semi-presidential system, the president serves as head of state and the prime minister serves as head of government.
These definitions are grounded in the functions that each office performs, as described above. Titles can be confusing. Do not assume, for example, that simply because an individual holds the title of "president" s/he is serving as the chief public representative of the country. Likewise, it may be that the effective head of state/head of government is someone other than the official head of state/head of government. In this instance, the following questions apply to the person who effectively wields this power. In some socialist systems, for example, the official head of state was a person within the state bureaucracy, but in practice the chief public representative of the country was the chairman of the communist party. It is the latter who is the "effective" head of state, and hence should be the focus of your answers. The same applies if the head of state/head of government is so old, sick or perhaps mentally disabled that s/he cannot perform his/her functions, which are instead performed by someone else. It is the latter person who is the effective head of state/head of government.
If you are considering a semi sovereign territory, such as a colony, an annexed territory or a member of the British Commonwealth, please answer the following questions with respect to the head of state and (if separate) the head of government who is located in the territory in question. Thus, in a typical British colony the governor-general-not the King/Queen of England-would be understood as the head of state. Likewise, in a British colony the local prime minister in the colony-not the prime minister in London-would be understood as the head of government.
In order to mitigate potential misunderstandings, the identities of the head of state and head of government for each country have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. Thus, when conducting your coding make sure to pay close attention to the names of these individuals, which you can see by clicking on the year grid for a particular year in the first question of this section, "HOS name." This is your key to what we mean by "head of state" or "head of government."
Note also that when the two functions are fused in the same office, we ask you to code only the head of state section of the survey. Any precoded years contain an orange triangle. This means that either the score or text and/or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the precoded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for the same executives. If you feel strongly that the precoded information is wrong, please rate your confidence in the preloaded information and then consult your V-Dem contact. You will have to rate confidence in all the available years in order to proceed to the next question.
In order to avoid spending time on short-lived executives, we have included only executives who held office for at least 100 days.
Executive - Historical clarification: In this section, we distinguish between the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG). The head of state is an individual or collective body that serves as the chief public representative of the country. Sometimes, this is a largely ceremonial role, e.g., a monarch who reigns but does not rule or a president whose powers are strictly circumscribed.
The head of government is the chief officer(s) of the executive branch of government, typically presiding over a cabinet. In a parliamentary system, this is usually the prime minister. In a presidential system, this is usually the president, who then servers as both head of state and head of government. In a typical semi-presidential system, the president serves as head of state and the prime minister serves as head of government. These definitions are grounded in the functions that each office performs, as described above. Titles can be confusing. Do not assume, for example, that simply because an individual holds the title of "president" s/he is serving as the chief public representative of the country.
Likewise, it may be that the effective head of state/head of government is someone other than the official head of state/head of government. In this instance, the following questions apply to the person who effectively wields this power. In some socialist systems, for example, the official head of state was a person within the state bureaucracy, but in practice the chief public representative of the country was the chairman of the communist party. It is the latter who is the "effective" head of state, and hence should be the focus of your answers. The same applies if the head of state/head of government is so old, sick or perhaps mentally disabled that s/he cannot perform his/her functions, which are instead performed by someone else. It is the latter person who is the effective head of state/head of government. This would apply for example to regency councils for underage monarchs. Note also that when the two functions are fused in the same office, we ask you to code only the head of state section of the survey.
In order to avoid spending time on short-lived executives, we have only included executives who held office for at least 100 days.
Head of Government (HOG): This section of the survey pertains to the head of government (HOG). Answer questions in this section only for years in which the head of government is not identical to the head of state, as indicated by a zero (0) in the year grid of the previous question.
If the effective head of government is someone other than the official head of government, or there is no official head of government, the questions apply to the effective head of government. In some socialist systems, for example, the official head of government could be a person within the state bureaucracy, but in practice the chief public representative of the country is the chairman of the communist party. We then want you to code only that effective head of government (and, if that is also the head of state, you can skip this section). The same applies if the official head of government is so old, sick or perhaps mentally disabled that s/he cannot perform his/her functions, which are instead performed by someone else.
Once again, the identities of the head of government for each country have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. Thus, when conducting your coding make sure to pay close attention to the names of these individuals, which you can see by clicking on the year grid for a particular year in the first question of this section, "HOG name." This is your key to what we mean by "head of government." Any precoded years contain an orange triangle. This means that either the score or text and/or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the precoded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for the same executives. If you feel strongly that the precoded information is wrong, please rate your confidence in the preloaded information and then consult your V-Dem contact. You will have to rate confidence in all the available years in order to proceed to the next question.

Executive as a whole: This final section of the survey pertains to the executive, considered as a whole. Some questions refer to "members of the executive", i.e., the head of state, the head of government, and cabinet ministers. If you feel that the answer to a question varies across these offices, your answer should reflect the average (arithmetic mean) across these offices. Other questions refer to lower-level members of the executive branch. This will be clarified as we proceed.
Regime - Part 1: Thank you for answering the survey on executive! We have been prompted by scholars and policy practitioners that data for the following questions related to the regimes would be really important for the research and policy advise. Please consider coding the three new questions that follow right after an important clarifying note and two pre-coded questions with information on what we consider are the country's regimes (at different points in time) and how they ended - this is completely voluntary.
Regime - Part 2: This final part of this section of the survey pertains to the political regime, and asks questions about the key supporting groups the regime relies on to stay in power.
A political regime can be defined as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power. If it is evident that formal and informal rules correspond (i.e. the formal rules are followed), then the formal rules define the regime. In these cases, we observe the formal rules (e.g. the constitution) to observe the regime. If, on the other hand, the formal rules do not correspond with the informal rules, such as in most dictatorships, then the regime is defined by the informal coalition of actors that select and sustain leaders, along with the informal rules they administer. In these cases, we must look to the de facto ruling elites and their established practice to observe the regime (e.g., the military junta in a military regime). Thus a regime is typically characterized by it determining who selects policies, and often also how these policies are typically selected. A regime change presupposes a substantial change in the formal and/or informal rules by which a country is governed.
Examples of regimes might include the Second French Republic, the Communist regime in post-WWII Poland, the current Saudi monarchic regime in Saudi Arabia and the post-WWII democratic regime in Austria. Sometimes, regime changes are related to government or leadership changes (such as the change in Zaire/DR Congo from the regime under Mobutu to the current regime under Kabila), but government or leadership changes do not necessarily bring regime changes (such as in post-election government changes in democracies or with the institutionalized changes to prime ministers and presidents in current China). Sometimes, regime changes can also take place without leadership changes (for instance when military juntas and leaders institutionalize one-party rule, or when there is substantial political liberalization e.g. by opening up for multi-party elections but where the former autocrat continues in power for some time).
Clarification: Please note that the default date for the pre-coded regime data is January 1st. Please also note that, in order to avoid overlapping data points, each regime unit is registered in the dataset as having started one day after it actually began (the true start date is reported in the next question on Regime information).

Responses:
0: Members of the executive violate the constitution whenever they want to, without legal consequences.
1: Members of the executive violate most provisions of the constitution without legal consequences, but still must respect certain provisions.
2: Somewhere in between (1) and (3). Members of the executive would face legal consequences for violating most provisions of the constitution, but can disregard some provisions without any legal consequences.
3: Members of the executive rarely violate the constitution, and when it happens they face legal charges.
4: Members of the executive never violate the constitution.

Responses:
0: It is routine and expected.
1: It happens more often than not in dealings with the executive.

Question: How often do members of the executive (the head of state, the head of government, and cabinet ministers), or their agents, steal, embezzle, or misappropriate public funds or other state resources for personal or family use?
Responses:
0: Constantly. Members of the executive act as though all public resources were their personal or family property.
1: Often. Members of the executive are responsible stewards of selected public resources but treat the rest like personal property.
2: About half the time. Members of the executive are about as likely to be responsible stewards of selected public resources as they are to treat them like personal property.
3: Occasionally. Members of the executive are responsible stewards of most public resources but treat selected others like personal property.
4: Never, or hardly ever. Members of the executive are almost always responsible stewards of public resources and keep them separate from personal or family property.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How routinely do public sector employees grant favors in exchange for bribes, kickbacks, or other material inducements?
Clarification: When responding to this question, we would like to you think about a typical person employed by the public sector, excluding the military. If you think there are large discrepancies between branches of the public sector, between the national/federal and subnational/state level, or between the core bureaucracy and employees working with public service delivery, please try to average them out before stating your response.
Responses:
0: Extremely common. Most public sector employees are systematically involved in petty but corrupt exchanges almost all the time.
1: Common. Such petty but corrupt exchanges occur regularly involving a majority of public employees.
2: Sometimes. About half or less than half of public sector employees engage in such exchanges for petty gains at times.
3: Scattered. A small minority of public sector employees engage in petty corruption from time to time.
4: No. Never, or hardly ever.

Clarification: If the head of state and the head of government are the same person or body, this and the following questions refer to both. Please provide a literal translation of the title in English, with the title in the native language, or a transcription thereof, within parentheses. If the head of state temporarily fills the role, this will be excluded from the answer; they should be called e.g. "President" and not "Acting President". Only heads of state that have been in office for at least 100 days should be included. If the head of state is a collective body, provide the title of the person exercising the most effective power over this body, or, if no such person exists, enter the expression "collective body."

Question: If the legislature, or either chamber of the legislature, took actions to remove the head of state from office, would it be likely to succeed even without having to level accusations of unlawful activity and without the involvement of any other agency?
Clarification: The question refers to whether the legislature (or either of its chambers) is considered to hold this power of removal in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not. Moreover, the question refers to removal other than through an impeachment process.
Responses:
0: No, under no circumstances.

Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: If the head of state took actions to dissolve the legislature, would he/she be likely to succeed?
Clarification: The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not. By "dissolving the legislature" we refer to the ability of the head of state to call a new election for the legislature.
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, but not at his/her own discretion, only when prompted to as a response to specific events (for example, after a certain number of votes of no confidence, or after a certain number of failed attempts to form a cabinet).
2: Yes, at his/her own discretion, but with restrictions (for example, by frequency, such as "once a year", by time point within term, such as "not within the last sixth months of the head of state's term", and by the requirement that the head of state must then himself/herself stand for election).
3: Yes, at his/her own discretion and without restrictions.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In practice, does the head of state have the power to appoint - or is the approval of the head of state necessary for the appointment of - cabinet ministers?
Clarification: The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not. If confirmation of the legislature is needed, this should be coded as such also when the HOS controls the majority of the legislature ("tacit consent"). Moreover, by the "legislature" in this case, we mean either house of the legislature (in the case of bicameralism).
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, but only with respect to the head of the cabinet, and only with the tacit consent or explicit confirmation by the legislature.
2: Yes, but only with the tacit consent or explicit confirmation by the legislature.
3: Yes, without any need for confirmation by the legislature, but only with respect to the head of the cabinet.
4: Yes, without any need for confirmation by the legislature.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In practice, does the head of state have the power to appoint - or is the approval of the head of state necessary for the appointment of - cabinet ministers?
Clarification: The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not. If confirmation of the legislature is needed, this should be coded as such also when the HOS controls the majority of the legislature ("tacit consent"). Moreover, by the "legislature" in this case, we mean either house of the legislature (in the case of bicameralism).
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, combines answer categories 1 and 2 from v2exdfcbhs.
2: Yes, combines answer categories 3 and 4 from v2exdfcbhs.
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: v2edfcbhs_rec is a version of v2exdfcbhs, for v2edfcbhs_rec the answer categories 1 and 2, 3 and 4 has been merged.

3.4.2.11	HOS veto power in practice (C) (v2exdfvths)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: If the head of state took actions to veto a piece of legislation, would he/she be likely to succeed?
Clarification: By "veto", we mean either a partial veto (concerning any parts of a bill) or package vetoes (concerning whole bills) of bills that have already been passed by the legislature. The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not.
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by a simple majority vote (a vote of more than half of those voting).
2: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by an absolute majority vote (a vote of more than half of the members of the legislature).
3: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by a qualified/extraordinary majority vote (a super-majority - e.g., 2/3 or 3/4 - of those voting). 4: Yes, with no possibility of override.

Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: If the head of state took actions to dismiss cabinet ministers, would he/she be likely to succeed?
Clarification: The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not, and regardless of possible political repercussions (e.g., vote of no confidence).
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, but not at his/her own discretion, only when prompted to as a response to specific events (for example, after a vote of no confidence taken by the legislature).
2: Yes, at his/her own discretion, but with restrictions (for example, only provided the head of state proposes an alternative minister who would need the legislature's approval, i.e., so called "constructive dismissal").
3: Yes, at his/her own discretion and without restrictions.

Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Does the head of state have the capacity, in practice, to propose legislation?
Clarification: By "propose legislation", we mean the introduction of legislative bills. The question refers to whether the head of state is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not.
Responses:
0: Yes, in all policy areas, including some exclusive domains (where neither the legislature nor other bodies may initiate bills).
1: Yes, in all policy areas, but this power is shared with the legislature and perhaps with other bodies.
2: No. The head of state cannot propose legislation.

3.4.2.14	HOS = HOG (A*) (v2exhoshog)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: Is the head of state (HOS) also head of government (HOG)?
Clarification: Note that this question only pertains to whether the head of state and the head of government are the same person or body, regardless of the relative powers of the two. Thus, in a constitutional monarchy, for example, the head of state and head of government are not the same even though the head of state may lack any real political power. If multiple head of states/head of governments were appointed in any year, please answer this question with respect to all of them by checking or unchecking the specific dates. Once again, the identities of the head of government for each country have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. Any pre-coded years contain an orange triangle. This means that either the score or text and/or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the pre-coded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for the same executives.
Responses:
0: No
1: Yes
Ordering: If HOS=HOG (answer is yes: 1) for all years: skip to "Executive as whole introduction"
[v2exintro3].

3.4.2.16	HOS selection by legislature in practice (A) (v2exaphos)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: Was approval of the legislature necessary for the appointment of the head of state?
Clarification: By "approval" we mean both explicit approval, such as through a vote of confidence, and tacit approval, such as a practice stating that the head of state has to have majority support (or should not be opposed by the majority) in the legislature even though no vote is taken on his/her appointment. We are not concerned with certification of electoral college votes (as in the US, Mexico).

3.4.2.19	HOS term length by law (A) (v2exfxtmhs)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: What is the maximum term length of the Head of State, in years?
Responses:
Numeric, number of years.
0: Term length not specified in constitution.
99: Not Applicable.
100: Term length for life or there is no term length.
Source(s): CCP (Elkins et al. 2012); National constitutions.
Notes: De jure term lengths for Head of State and Head of Government, coded for each head of state and head of government as coded in v2exnamhos and v2exnamhog. In the case of a single office representing both Head of State and Head of Government, HOS is coded to the appropriate term length while HOG is coded as 99. For colonies, if there was no official local constitution, HOS/HOG is coded by their constitutional status according to the colonial power. Finally, for sovereign states lacking a constitution or having suspended their constitution, HOS/HOG is coded to 99 as not applicable for those relevant years.
Changes to term lengths are recorded as occurring on the date that a new constitution or constitutional amendment takes force, or, if unavailable, date of promulgation.

3.4.2.20	HOS appointment in practice (A) (v2expathhs)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: How did the head of state reach office?
Clarification: If several bodies were involved in the appointment process, select the one that exerted the most critical impact on the decision. However, in the next question we ask separately about whether the approval of the legislature was necessary. Response category 7 should only be selected if the head of state is directly elected, not if he or she was appointed by the legislature after an election. We count as direct elections (category 7) also those indirect elections carried out by an electoral college, whose only purpose is to elect the president.
Responses:
0: Through the threat of or application of force, such as a coup or rebellion.
1: Appointed by a foreign power.
2: Appointed by the ruling party (in a one-party system).
3: Appointed by a royal council.
4: Through hereditary succession.
5: Appointed by the military.
6: Appointed by the legislature.
7: Directly through a popular election (regardless of the extension of the suffrage). 8: Other.
Ordering: If you select 0 or 8, proceed to the next question [v2exothhs]. If you select 1-5, skip to question "HOS selection by legislature in practice [v2exaphos]". If you selected 6-7, skip to question [v2excomhs].
Scale: Nominal (v2expathhs), or a series of dichotomous scales.
Source(s): V-Dem country coordinators; constituteproject.org; IPU Parline.
Notes: Converted from B to A coding. v2expathhs is coded according to appointment dates of the Head of State. The same is true for coups or rebellions where the date when the HOS was appointed through a coup, or the first day in office after the coup, is coded.

3.4.2.22	HOS party affiliation (A) (v2exparhos)
Project Manager(s): Nils Düpont
Question: What is the name of the political party to which the head of state belongs?
Clarification: "Technical" refers to non-party leaders, such as members of the royal family, military leaders, foreign leaders, governors, or collective bodies. "Independent" refers to leaders without party affiliation in systems where the leader would normally be affiliated to a party. This does not include leaders in systems where a candidate who is running on a party platform is required to leave the party for the duration of their term. Appointed leaders are considered to be affiliated with the party or body that appointed them.

Question: What is the name of the head of government?
Clarification: If the head of government is a collective body, provide the name of the person executing the most effective power over this body, or, if no such person exists, enter the expression "collective body." Do not include nicknames. If multiple heads of government were appointed any given year, please answer this question with respect to each one of them; also make sure you enter the specific date of appointment and reappointment for each one of them. Only heads of government that have been in office for at least 100 days should be included.

Clarification: Please provide a literal translation of the title in English, with the title in the native language, or a transcription thereof, within parentheses. If the head of government temporarily fills the role, this will be excluded from the answer; they should be called e.g. "Prime Minister" and not "Acting Prime Minister". Only heads of government that have been in office for at least 100 days should be included. If the head of government is a collective body, provide the title of the person exercising the most effective power over this body, or, if no such person exists, the name of the entire body. If multiple heads of government with different titles were appointed any given year, please answer this question with respect to all of them; also make sure you enter the specific date of appointment for each one of them.

Clarification: The question refers to whether the head of government is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not. If confirmation of the legislature is needed, this should be coded as such also when the HOG controls the majority of the legislature ("tacit consent").

The question refers to whether the head of government is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not.
Responses:
0: No.
1: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by a simple majority vote (a vote of more than half of those voting).
2: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by an absolute majority vote (a vote of more than half of the members of the legislature).
3: Yes, but the legislature can override the veto by a qualified/extraordinary majority vote (a super-majority - e.g., 2/3 or 3/4 - of those voting). 4: Yes, with no possibility of override.

Question: Does the head of government have the capacity, in practice, to propose legislation?
Clarification: By "propose legislation", we mean the introduction of legislative bills. The question refers to whether the head of government is considered to hold this power in practice, regardless of whether this is regulated by law and whether this power has been exercised or not.
0: Yes, in all policy areas, including some exclusive domains (where neither the legislature nor other bodies may initiate bills).
1: Yes, in all policy areas, but this power is shared with the legislature and perhaps with other bodies.
2: No. The head of government cannot propose legislation.

Clarification: If several bodies were involved in the appointment process, select the one that exerted the most critical impact on the decision. However, in the next question we ask separately about whether the approval of the legislature was necessary. Response category 8 should only be selected if the head of government is directly elected, not if he or she was appointed by the legislature after an election. If the same person or body is both head of state and head of government, they are only coded as head of state.
Responses:
0: Through the threat of or application of force, such as a coup or rebellion.
1: Appointed by a foreign power.

4: Through hereditary succession.
5: Appointed by the military.
6: Appointed by the head of state.
7: Appointed by the legislature.
8: Directly through a popular election (regardless of the extension of the suffrage). 9: Other.

3.4.4	Regime
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

  This survey pertains to the political regime, and asks questions about the support groups the regime relies on to stay in power and key opposition groups. "A support group is a group of individuals who are supportive of the existing regime, and, if it were to retract support would substantially increase the chance that the regime would lose power. A key opposition group is defined as a group of individuals (mobilized or not) who both want to and who could, under favorable circumstances, be able to remove the existing political regime." A political regime can be defined as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power.
If it is evident that formal and informal rules correspond (i.e. the formal rules are followed), then the formal rules define the regime. In these cases, we observe the formal rules (e.g. the constitution) to observe the regime. If, on the other hand, the formal rules do not correspond with the informal rules, such as in most dictatorships, then the regime is defined by the informal coalition of actors that select and sustain leaders, along with the informal rules they administer. In these cases, we must look to the de facto ruling elites and their established practice to observe the regime (e.g., the military junta in a military regime).
Thus a regime is typically characterized by it determining who selects policies, and often also how these policies are typically selected. A regime change presupposes a substantial change in the formal and/or informal rules by which a country is governed.
Examples of regimes might include the Second French Republic, the Communist regime in post-WWII Poland, the current Saudi monarchic regime in Saudi Arabia and the post-WWII democratic regime in Austria. Sometimes, regime changes are related to government or leadership changes (such as the change in Zaire/DR Congo from the regime under Mobutu to the current regime under Kabila), but government or leadership changes do not necessarily bring regime changes (such as in post-election government changes in democracies or with the institutionalized changes to prime ministers and presidents in current China). Sometimes, regime changes can also take place without leadership changes (for instance when military juntas and leaders institutionalize one-party rule, or when there is substantial political liberalization e.g. by opening up for multi-party elections but where the former autocrat continues in power for some time).

3.4.4.4	Regime interregnum (A) (v2regint)
Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen, Tore Wig, Vilde Lunnan Djuve Question: Does there exist an identifiable political regime?
Clarification: This question is used to identify so-called interregnum periods, where no political regime is in control over the entity. Different types of political situations can lead to periods of time under which there is no identifiable political regime, one example being a civil war in which none of the parties have clear control over political bodies and processes in the country. However, the interregnum coding is employed conservatively, meaning that partial control over political bodies and processes in fairly large parts of the country (which is often the case also during civil wars) is sufficient for a 0 score.

Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In total, how large is the percentage share of the domestic adult (18+) population that belongs to the political regime's supporting groups?
Clarification: You should consider the sum of all the groups (excepting foreign governments and colonial powers) entered in v2regsupgroups. Hence, your answer should take into account the total size of the/those groups that are supportive of the regime, and, if it/they were to retract support would substantially increase the chance that the regime would lose power. Regarding the issue of overlapping identities, and one individual potentially belonging to more than one groups: Individuals should only be "counted" once; thus if the two relevant supporting groups are (4) civil servants, which total about 5%, and all of them belong to a particular ethnic group (6) also coded as a relevant, the overall total size of the supporting groups is still 5% (presuming that no other members of that ethnic group are essential for the regime staying in power).
Responses:
0: Extremely small
(About 1 percent of the population or less; examples of this could include regimes supported by - and needing the support from - a handful of higher-rank military officers, or by only a royal council and a few hundred landowners)
1: Very small
(Between 1 percent and 5 percent of the population; examples of this could include regimes supported by - and needing the support from - higher ranking civil servants and the military, or by moderately sized business and agrarian elites) 2: Small
(Between 5 percent and 15 percent; examples of this could include regimes supported by - and needing the support from - relatively small ethnic groups, or by urban elites and the urban middle classes in predominantly rural societies)
3: Moderate
(Between 15 percent and 30 percent; examples of this could include regimes supported by - and needing the support from - moderately sized ethnic groups, by rural middle classes in rural societies, or by urban middle classes in urban societies)
4: Large
(More than 30 percent; examples of this could include regimes supported by - and needing the support from - large ethnic groups (and then not only the elites/leaders of such groups), or by rural working classes in rural societies.)

In other words, these individuals must both want to see the regime removed and, at least under hypothetical "favorable conditions", be capable of removing the regime. Groups need not be actively mobilized or explicitly engaged in high-level opposition activities to be counted; opposition groups also include individuals who oppose the regime without taking particular actions, at the moment. We remind you of the definition of a regime as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power. Hence, we are not asking about which groups oppose the current government in a democracy (and who would vote for another party), but still accept the democratic rules as legitimate. We are, instead, asking about groups that want to see the wider political regime removed and replaced.

3.4.4.12	Explicit and active regime opposition groups (C) (v2regoppgroupsact)
Project Manager(s): Sirianne Dahlum, Tore Wig
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Which (if any) groups include a significant share of individuals who explicitly and actively mobilize against the regime in a particular year? (Check all that apply.)
Clarification: Consider which group(s) include a significant share of individuals who engage in active and explicit opposition to the regime to promote its removal. These actors make explicit statements of dissent from the regime, publicly voice their preference for regime change, and may possibly engage in other actions intended to further the removal of the regime such as anti-regime demonstrations, sit-ins, boycotts, strikes, the formation of anti-system parties, acts of sabotage, or armed rebellion.Please note that only years when anti-regime speech or activity occurs should be coded. In years when groups probably oppose the regime, but are not engaged in any explicit acts of opposition, the group should not be selected. We remind you of the definition of a regime as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power. Hence, we are not asking about which groups oppose the current government in a democracy (and who would vote for another party), but still accept the democratic rules as legitimate.

3.4.4.13	Regime most important opposition group (C) (v2regimpoppgroup)
Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Which (one) group constitutes the greatest threat to the current regime?
Clarification: Choose the one group (among those you registered as opposition groups under the v2regoppgroups question) that is the most dangerous threat to the regime in a given year. That is, the group that could most strongly increase the chance that the regime loses power. The importance/danger associated with an opposition group will be affected both by its level of hostility towards the regime and its power resources/how capable it is of removing the regime should it try to do so. We remind you that groups need not be actively mobilized or explicitly engaged in high-level opposition activities to be counted; key opposition groups may include actors who oppose the regime and constitute a dormant threat to the regime, even though they do not take particular actions in a given year.
Responses:
0: The aristocracy, including high status hereditary social groups and castes.
1: Agrarian elites, including rich peasants and large landholders.

Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In total, how large is the share of the domestic adult (18+) population that are noteworthy opposition actors to the current political regime?
Clarification: Consider the sum total of all the groups (excepting foreign governments and colonial powers) entered in v2regoppgroups. Hence, your answer should take into account the total size/number of the actors that oppose the regime and pose a threat to the regime maintaining power.
We remind you that groups need not be actively mobilized or explicitly engaged in high-level opposition activities to be counted; key opposition groups may include actors who oppose the regime and constitute a dormant threat to the regime, even though they do not take particular actions in a given year.
Regarding the issue of individuals potentially belonging to more than one "opposition group": Individuals should only be "counted" once for the purpose of this question. For example, if the two relevant opposition groups are (4) civil servants, which total about 5% of the population, and all of them belong to a particular ethnic group (6) also coded as a relevant, the overall total size of the opposition groups is still 5% (presuming that there are no other members of that ethnic group who oppose the regime).
We remind you of the definition of a regime as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power. Hence, we are not asking about which groups oppose the current government in a democracy (and who would vote for another party), but still accept the democratic rules as legitimate. We are, instead, asking about groups that want to see the wider political regime removed and replaced.
Responses:
0: Extremely small (About 1 percent of the population or less)
1: Very small (Between 1 percent and 5 percent of the population)
2: Small (Between 5 percent and 15 percent)
3: Moderate (Between 15 percent and 30 percent)

Question: In which geographic area do groups opposing the current political regime mainly reside?
Clarification: You should consider the groups entered in v2regoppgroups, hence groups that both want to see the regime removed and (at least under "favorable conditions") are capable of removing the regime.We remind you that groups need not be actively mobilized or explicitly engaged in high-level opposition activities to be counted; key opposition groups may include actors who oppose the regime and constitute a dormant threat to the regime, even though they do not take particular actions in a given year.

3.4.4.16	Strongest pro-regime preferences (C) (v2regproreg)
Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Which (one) group has the strongest pro-regime preferences, irrespective of the group's resources and capabilities for affecting the regime's hold on power?
Clarification: Consider only the pro-regime preferences of individuals in this group, and do not take into consideration the abilities of this group to actually affect regime survival. Hence, the group with the strongest pro-regime preferences need not be the most important support group.
One way to think about what pro-/anti-regime preferences means is: what would individuals hypothetically (honestly) answer if asked in a survey: "On a scale from 0-10, how pleased are you with the current political regime, with 10 indicating the strongest support." Select the group with the highest average score in this hypothetical survey.
We remind you of the definition of a regime as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power. Hence, we are not asking about which groups oppose the current government in a democracy (and who would vote for another party), but still accept the democratic rules as legitimate. We are, instead, asking about groups that want to see the wider political regime removed and replaced.
Responses:

3.4.4.17	Strongest anti-regime preferences (C) (v2regantireg)
Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Which (one) group has the strongest anti-regime preferences/antipathy against the current regime, irrespective of the group's resources and capabilities for affecting the regime's hold on power?
Clarification: Consider only the anti-regime preferences of the actors in this group, and do not take into consideration the abilities of this group to actually affect regime survival and change. Hence, the group with the strongest anti-regime preferences need not be the most important opposition group. Both capable and incapable political actors may have strong anti-regime preferences and want to see the regime removed from power. We also remind that the group needs not be currently mobilized or explicitly engaged in high-level opposition activities to be counted; individuals may strongly resent a regime, without taking particular actions, in a given year.
One way to think about what pro-/anti-regime preferences mean, independently of ability to affect regime survival is: what would individuals hypothetically (honestly) answer if asked in a survey: "On a scale from 0-10, how pleased are you with the current political regime". We remind you of the definition of a regime as the set of formal and/or informal rules that are essential for choosing political leaders and/or maintaining political leaders in power.

Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Irrespective of its stance toward the regime (pro-, anti-, or neutral), which one group is the most important for affecting the current regime's chances of staying in power?
Clarification: Here we ask you to disregard group preferences, and only consider a group's resources and capabilities vis-a-vis affecting regime survival. In other words, do not consider whether this group is pro-regime, anti-regime, or neutral to the regime. Take only into consideration the capabilities of this group to affect regime survival, if key members of the group were to hypothetically mobilize the group in an effort to remove the regime. Politically neutral, as well as pro- and anti-regime groups, may have ample resources and be capable of organizing coordinated action. As a result, all three types of groups may have great influence over regime survival and change.
Responses:
0: The aristocracy, including high status hereditary social groups and castes.

3.5 The Legislature
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

The Legislature: The following questions pertain to the legislature, an assembly of deputies or representatives with powers to consider, pass, amend, or repeal laws. If there is no legislature in the country you are coding for some period of years, do not code any questions for those year. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory such as a colony please answer this question with respect to the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the Parliament in London). A popular election need not involve universal suffrage; indeed, suffrage may be highly restricted. A "direct election" can include seats reserved for special groups (e.g., ethnic groups or women) so long as these members are chosen by popular election.
Frequently, it is important to distinguish between formal rules (as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent) and actual practice (what happens on the ground). In order to clarify the de jure/de facto distinction, we employ the terms "by law..." and "in practice..." Please pay close attention to these cues. Note that sometimes we ask different coders to code different aspects of a question. So, you might get a question about the de facto state of affairs, but another source might provide the answer to the de jure state of affairs.
Upper Chamber: The following questions pertain to the upper chamber of the legislature (if bicameral; please only code for those years where v2lgbicam is 2). The upper chamber in a bicameral legislature, often called the "senate" or sometimes the "first chamber", typically means the less numerous chamber that is also less directly representative of the general population.
If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer these questions with respect to the upper chamber of the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the senate or upper chamber of a local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the House of Lords in London).
One or both houses:	The following questions pertain to one or both houses.
Lower chamber: The following questions pertain to the lower or unicameral chamber of the legislature. The lower chamber in a bicameral legislature, sometimes also called the "second chamber", is typically the more numerous chamber and also more directly representative of the general population.
If there is no legislature in the country you are coding for some period of years, do not code any questions for those years. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer these questions with respect to the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the lower chamber of a local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the House of Commons in London).
Country experts will find the name (proper noun) of the lower chamber of the legislature in the first question (following this page). To see the name, click on any year in the grid. All subsequent questions in this section pertain to that body.
3.5.1	General
3.5.1.1	Legislature bicameral (A*) (v2lgbicam)
Project Manager(s): Steven Fish, Matthew Kroenig
Question: How many chambers does the legislature contain?
Clarification: The number of chambers have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. This means that the score has already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the pre-coded rating. If there is a change in the number of chambers, this is coded on the exact date of when the change occurred, for example the exact date of when a legislature was dissolved, or when the lower and/or upper chamber was established (usually coded on the date when the new legislature first meets; otherwise on the date of the legislative election where the composition of the new legislature was decided).
Responses:
0: 0 chambers.
1: 1 chamber.
2: 2 or more chambers.
Scale: Ordinal.

Notes: For the country-year aggregation of the dataset, we have taken the minimum value of v2lgbicam. Constituent assemblies that perform other functions except for drafting and adopting a new constitution (e.g. legislating, electing president, adopting budget, etc) are coded as 1 (1 chamber). In cases when a parliament consists of three or more chambers, one of the chamber names is coded in the variable "Lower chamber legislature name" (v2lgnamelo), while the others are listed in the variable "Upper chamber name" (v2lgnameup). South Africa had a three-chamber parliament during the period of 1984-1994. Subsequently, variable v2lgbicam is coded 2, v2lgnamelo is coded "House of Assembly", and v2lgnameup enlists "House of Representatives, House of Delegates".

Please make your best estimate, based upon what is known or suspected to be true.
Responses:
0: Commonly. Most legislators probably engage in these activities.
1: Often. Many legislators probably engage in these activities.

3.5.1.9	Representation of disadvantaged social groups (C) (v2lgdsadlo)
Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Considering all disadvantaged social groups in the country, how well represented are these groups, as a whole, in the national legislature?
Clarification: Disadvantage refers to socioeconomic disadvantage. Specifically, in order to be considered disadvantaged members of a social group must have an average income that is significantly below the median national income.
Responses:
0 (1): They have no representation at all.
1 (2): They are highly under-represented relative to their proportion of the general population. 2 (3): They are slightly under-represented relative to their proportion of the general population. 3 (4): They are represented roughly equal relative to their proportion of the general population. 4 (5): They are over-represented relative to their proportion of the general population.
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: As of December 2014, the former category 0: There are no disadvantaged groups in the society, is coded as a separate variable (v2lgdsadlobin). The variable is then rebased to zero.

3.5.3.10	Lower chamber gender quota (A) (v2lgqugen)
Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton
Question: Is there a national-level gender quota for the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature?
Clarification: National-level quotas either reserve some seats for women in the legislature (as a whole or per district) or mandate through statutory law that all political parties must nominate a certain percentage of female candidates or candidates considered for nomination. A sanction for noncompliance imposes a penalty on a party that fails to meet the quota provisions. Examples of sanctions for noncompliance include rejection of the party list, loss of public campaign funds, or other financial penalties. Weak sanctions are those that parties may be able to ignore, such as a very weak financial penalty. Strong sanctions provide strong deterrents for noncompliance. An example of a strong sanction would be the rejection of a party's list. Countries with both candidate quotas and reserved seats are recorded at the stronger level. This variable records quotas from the date of implementation. The quota adoption date may be earlier, sometimes by several years. Data on quota adoption is available from the QAROT dataset (Hughes, Paxton, Clayton, and Zetterberg 2017) while the theoretical implications of adoption vs. implementation are discussed in Hughes, Paxton, Clayton, and Zetterberg (2018).
Responses:
0: No national level gender quota.
1: Yes, a statutory gender quota for all parties without sanctions for noncompliance.
2: Yes, statutory gender quota for all parties with weak sanctions for noncompliance.
3. Yes, statutory gender quota for all parties with strong sanctions for noncompliance. 4: Yes, there are reserved seats in the legislature for women.

Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton
Question: Does the national-level quota for the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature contain a placement mandate?
Clarification: A placement mandate is a rule concerning rank order on the party list, usually to ensure that women are placed in electable positions on the party list. An example would a rule stating that no more than three of the top five candidates can be of the same gender. Coded only for years where a gender quota was present.

3.6 Deliberation
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Deliberation: The following questions address the deliberative or non-deliberative nature of a country's politics, with particular focus on elite levels. Some of these questions focus on the quality of discourse and others focus on public policies.
3.6.0.1	Reasoned justification (C) (v2dlreason)
Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, John Gerring, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: When important policy changes are being considered, i.e. before a decision has been made, to what extent do political elites give public and reasoned justifications for their positions?
Clarification: Because discourse varies greatly from person to person, base your answer on the style that is most typical of prominent national political leaders.
Responses:
0: No justification. Elites almost always only dictate that something should or should not be done, but no reasoning about justification is given. For example, "We must cut spending." 1: Inferior justification. Elites tend to give reasons why someone should or should not be for doing or not doing something, but the reasons tend to be illogical or false, although they may appeal to many voters. For example, "We must cut spending. The state is inefficient." [The inference is incomplete because addressing inefficiencies would not necessarily reduce spending and it might undermine essential services.]
2: Qualified justification. Elites tend to offer a single simple reason justifying why the proposed policies contribute to or detract from an outcome. For example, "We must cut spending because taxpayers cannot afford to pay for current programs."
3: Sophisticated justification. Elites tend to offer more than one or more complex, nuanced and complete justification. For example, "We must cut spending because taxpayers cannot afford to pay for current government programs. Raising taxes would hurt economic growth, and deficit spending would lead to inflation."

Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, John Gerring, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: When important policy changes are being considered, to what extent do political elites justify their positions in terms of the common good?
Clarification: Because discourse varies greatly from person to person, base your answer on the style that is most typical of prominent national political leaders.
Responses:
0: Little or no justification in terms of the common good is usually offered.
1: Specific business, geographic, group, party, or constituency interests are for the most part offered as justifications.
2: Justifications are for the most part a mix of specific interests and the common good and it is impossible to say which justification is more common than the other.
3: Justifications are based on a mixture of references to constituency/party/group interests
and on appeals to the common good.
4: Justifications are for the most part almost always based on explicit statements of the common good for society, understood either as the greatest good for the greatest number or as helping the least advantaged in a society.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: When important policy changes are being considered, to what extent do political elites acknowledge and respect counterarguments?
Clarification: Because discourse varies greatly from person to person, base your answer on the style that is most typical of prominent national political leaders.
Responses:
0: Counterarguments are not allowed or if articulated, punished.
1: Counterarguments are allowed at least from some parties, but almost always are ignored. 2: Elites tend to acknowledge counterarguments but then explicitly degrade them by making a negative statement about them or the individuals and groups that propose them. 3: Elites tend to acknowledge counterarguments without making explicit negative or positive statements about them.
4: Elites almost always acknowledge counterarguments and explicitly value them, even if they ultimately reject them for the most part.
5: Elites almost always acknowledge counterarguments and explicitly value them, and frequently also even accept them and change their position.

Question: When important policy changes are being considered, how wide is the range of consultation at elite levels?
Clarification: Because practices vary greatly from policy to policy, base your answer on the style that is most typical of policymaking.
Responses:
0: No consultation. The leader or a very small group (e.g. military council) makes authoritative decisions on their own.
1: Very little and narrow. Consultation with only a narrow circle of loyal party/ruling elites.
2: Consultation includes the former plus a larger group that is loyal to the government, such
as the ruling party's or parties' local executives and/or women, youth and other branches.
3: Consultation includes the former plus leaders of other parties.
4:	Consultation	includes	the	former	plus	a	select	range	of	society/labor/business representatives.

Question: When important policy changes are being considered, how wide and how independent are public deliberations?
Clarification: This question refers to deliberation as manifested in discussion, debate, and other public forums such as popular media.
Responses:
0: Public deliberation is never, or almost never allowed.
1: Some limited public deliberations are allowed but the public below the elite levels is almost always either unaware of major policy debates or unable to take part in them.
2: Public deliberation is not repressed but nevertheless infrequent and non-elite actors are typically controlled and/or constrained by the elites.
3: Public deliberation is actively encouraged and some autonomous non-elite groups participate, but it is confined to a small slice of specialized groups that tends to be the same across issue-areas.
4: Public deliberation is actively encouraged and a relatively broad segment of non-elite groups often participate and vary with different issue-areas.
5: Large numbers of non-elite groups as well as ordinary people tend to discuss major policies among themselves, in the media, in associations or neighborhoods, or in the streets. Grass-roots deliberation is common and unconstrained.

3.6.0.6	Particularistic or public goods (C) (v2dlencmps)
Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, John Gerring, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Considering the profile of social and infrastructural spending in the national budget, how "particularistic" or "public goods" are most expenditures?
Clarification: Particularistic spending is narrowly targeted on a specific corporation, sector, social group, region, party, or set of constituents. Such spending may be referred to as "pork",
"clientelistic", or "private goods."
Public-goods spending is intended to benefit all communities within a society, though it may be means-tested so as to target poor, needy, or otherwise underprivileged constituents. The key point is that all who satisfy the means-test are allowed to receive the benefit.
Your answer should consider the entire budget of social and infrastructural spending. We are interested in the relative value of particularistic and public-goods spending, not the number of bills or programs that fall into either category.
Responses:
0: Almost all of the social and infrastructure expenditures are particularistic.
1: Most social and infrastructure expenditures are particularistic, but a significant portion (e.g. 1/4 or 1/3) is public-goods.
2: Social and infrastructure expenditures are evenly divided between particularistic and publicgoods programs.
3: Most social and infrastructure expenditures are public-goods but a significant portion (e.g., 1/4 or 1/3) is particularistic.
4: Almost all social and infrastructure expenditures are public-goods in character. Only a small portion is particularistic.

Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, John Gerring, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How many welfare programs are means-tested and how many benefit all (or virtually all) members of the polity?
Clarification: A means-tested program targets poor, needy, or otherwise underprivileged constituents. Cash-transfer programs are normally means-tested.
A universal (non-means tested) program potentially benefits everyone. This includes free education, national health care schemes, and retirement programs. Granted, some may benefit more than others from these programs (e.g., when people with higher salaries get higher unemployment benefits). The key point is that practically everyone is a beneficiary, or potential beneficiary.
The purpose of this question is not to gauge the size of the welfare state but rather its quality. So, your answer should be based on whatever programs exist.
Responses:
0: There are no, or extremely limited, welfare state policies (education, health, retirement, unemployment, poverty programs).
1: Almost all of the welfare state policies are means-tested.
2: Most welfare state policies means-tested, but a significant portion (e.g. 1/4 or 1/3) is universalistic and potentially benefits everyone in the population.
3:	The welfare state policies are roughly evenly divided between means-tested and universalistic.
4: Most welfare state policies are universalistic, but a significant portion (e.g., 1/4 or 1/3) are means-tested.
5:	Almost all welfare state policies are universal in character.	Only a small portion is means-tested.

3.7 The Judiciary
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Judiciary: This set of questions pertains to the judiciary. Before you proceed, we would like to clarify several general points. First, some questions below refer to the judiciary in general, whereas others ask for specific evaluations of particular courts or types of courts. Unless otherwise prompted, please consider the judiciary as a whole. This includes all courts in the judicial system at every level, both general jurisdiction courts and more specialized courts. However, with potentially one exception, it excludes specialized courts that are located outside the judiciary, e.g. an immigration court that lies inside the executive branch. The one potential exception is the peak constitutional court of the country. Please include this court in your considerations, even though it will be located outside of the judiciary in some countries. If the country you are coding is a federal state, please focus only on the federal judiciary and the federal government.
Seven of the questions about the judiciary concern high courts. By "high court" we are asking you to consider the country's constitutional court, if one exists. If there is no constitutional court, please consider the court of last resort for constitutional matters. If there is no court in your country with constitutional jurisdiction, please consider the highest ordinary court of the state.
For example, in Mexico in 2004, you would consider the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and not the Electoral Tribunal for the Federal Judiciary. In Russia in the same year, you would consider the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and not the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. In Sweden, you would ignore the Supreme Administrative Court and instead focus on the Supreme Court. Germany has both a constitutional court, the Federal Constitutional Court, and a court of last resort for ordinary matters, the Federal Court of Justice. The Federal Constitutional Court is the high court for our purposes. In the United States, there is no separate constitutional court or review body. The Supreme Court is both the highest ordinary court and the highest court in the state with constitutional jurisdiction. Therefore, we consider it to be the high court of the United States. smallskip If your country's highest judicial body has separate divisions, only one of which is dedicated to final constitutional review, please consider that division to be the high court if its judges are permanently assigned to that division only. For example, the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica has four chambers. The Fourth Chamber reviews constitutional matters, its judges are appointed to it specifically and the other judges of the Supreme Court do not rotate onto the Fourth Chamber. Therefore, the high court for Costa Rica is the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.
If a new high court was established in a given year, please consider that court as the high court for the purposes of these questions only if the court was functioning for the majority of the calendar year. If a new high court was established in a given year, but did not start functioning until a subsequent year, please do not consider the new court as the high court until it was functioning for the majority of the given calendar year. If you are considering a semi sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer this question with respect to the government or judicial bodies seated within the territory in question (e.g., the governor-general and his local administration in a British colony or a Commonwealth country), not abroad (e.g., the King/Queen or government of England).
In coding the following questions it is sometimes important to distinguish between formal rules (as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent) and actual practice (what happens "on the ground"). In order to clarify the de jure/de facto distinction, we employ the terms "by law..." and "in practice..." Please pay close attention to these cues wherever you see them.
3.7.0.1	Judicial reform (C) (v2jureform)
Project Manager(s): Jeffrey Staton
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Were the judiciary's formal powers altered this year in ways that affect its ability to control the arbitrary use of state authority?
Clarification: Evidence of this kind of reform could include the creation or removal of various forms of constitutional review, new rules increasing or decreasing access to the judiciary, changes in available judicial remedies, and any other formal institution (procedural or otherwise) that influences the ability of courts to control the arbitrary use of power.
Responses:
0: The judiciary's ability to control arbitrary power was reduced via institutional reform. 1: There was no change to the judiciary's ability to control arbitrary power via institutional review.
2: The judiciary's ability to control arbitrary power was enhanced via institutional reform.

3.7.0.2	Judicial purges (C) (v2jupurge)
Project Manager(s): Jeffrey Staton
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Judges are sometimes removed from their posts for cause, as when there is strong evidence of corruption; however, some judges are removed arbitrarily, typically for political reasons. With this distinction in mind, please describe the removal of judges that occurred this calendar year.
Clarification: The second and third response categories permit you to distinguish among limited arbitrary removals (i.e., when only a few judges are targeted) by the political importance of the removal. For example, you may consider the arbitrary removal of a few high court judges as more important than the arbitrary removal of a few lower court judges.
Responses:
0: There was a massive, arbitrary purge of the judiciary.
1: There were limited but very important arbitrary removals.
2: There were limited arbitrary removals.
3: Judges were removed from office, but there is no evidence that the removals were arbitrary. 4: Judges were not removed from their posts.

3.7.0.3	Government attacks on judiciary (C) (v2jupoatck)
Project Manager(s): Jeffrey Staton
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How often did the government attack the judiciary's integrity in public?
Clarification: Attacks on the judiciary's integrity can include claims that it is corrupt, incompetent or that decisions were politically motivated. These attacks can manifest in various ways including, but not limited to prepared statements reported by the media, press conferences, interviews, and stump speeches.
Responses:
0: Attacks were carried out on a daily or weekly basis.
1: Attacks were common and carried out in nearly every month of the year.
2: Attacks occurred more than once.
3: There were attacks, but they were rare.
4: There were no attacks on the judiciary's integrity.

3.7.0.4	Court packing (C) (v2jupack)
Project Manager(s): Jeffrey Staton
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: The size of the judiciary is sometimes increased for very good reasons, as when judges are added to manage an increasing caseload; however, sometimes judges are added purely for political reasons. With this distinction in mind, please describe any increases in the size of the judiciary that occurred this calendar year.
Clarification: The second and third response categories permit you to distinguish among limited court packing efforts (i.e. when relatively few judgeships are added) by the political importance of the packing. For example, you may consider the packing of the high court to be more important than the packing of a lower court.
Responses:
0: There was a massive, politically motivated increase in the number of judgeships across the entire judiciary.
1: There was a limited, politically motivated increase in the number of judgeships on very important courts.
2: There was a limited, politically motivated increase in the number of judgeships.
3: Judgeships were added to the judiciary, but there is no evidence that the increase was politically motivated; or there was no increase.
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: A previous version of the variable contained category "4: There was no increase". As of November 2014, all responses in category "4" are assigned to category "3", since the two responses have the same meaning in practice.

Question: When the high court in the judicial system is ruling in cases that are salient to the government, how often would you say that it makes decisions that merely reflect government wishes regardless of its sincere view of the legal record?
Clarification: We are seeking to identify autonomous judicial decision-making and its absence. Decisions certainly can reflect government wishes without "merely reflecting" those wishes, i.e. a court can be autonomous when its decisions support the government's position. This is because a court can be fairly persuaded that the government's position is meritorious. By "merely reflect the wishes of the government" we mean that the court's own view of the record, its sincere evaluation of the record, is irrelevant to the outcome. The court simply adopts the government's position regardless of its sincere view of the record.

3.8 Civil Liberty
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Civil Liberty: The following questions are focused on actual practices (de facto) rather than formal legal or constitutional rights (de jure). Note that if there is significant variation in the respect for a particular civil liberty across the territory, the score should reflect the "average situation" across the territorial scope of the country unit (for each period) as defined in the coder instructions.

Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is there freedom from torture?
Clarification: Torture refers to the purposeful inflicting of extreme pain, whether mental or physical, with an aim to extract information or intimidate victims, who are in a state of incarceration. Here, we are concerned with torture practiced by state officials or other agents of the state (e.g., police, security forces, prison guards, and paramilitary groups).
Responses:
0: Not respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced systematically and is incited and approved by the leaders of government.
1: Weakly respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced frequently but is often not incited or approved by top leaders of government. At the same time, leaders of government are not actively working to prevent it.
2: Somewhat. Torture is practiced occasionally but is typically not approved by top leaders of government.
3: Mostly respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced in a few isolated cases but is not incited or approved by top government leaders.
4: Fully respected by public authorities. Torture is non-existent.

3.8.1.2	Freedom from political killings (C) (v2clkill)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is there freedom from political killings?
Clarification: Political killings are killings by the state or its agents without due process of law for the purpose of eliminating political opponents. These killings are the result of deliberate use of lethal force by the police, security forces, prison officials, or other agents of the state (including paramilitary groups).
Responses:
0: Not respected by public authorities. Political killings are practiced systematically and they are typically incited and approved by top leaders of government.
1: Weakly respected by public authorities. Political killings are practiced frequently and top leaders of government are not actively working to prevent them.
2: Somewhat respected by public authorities. Political killings are practiced occasionally but they are typically not incited and approved by top leaders of government.
3: Mostly respected by public authorities. Political killings are practiced in a few isolated cases
but they are not incited or approved by top leaders of government.
4: Fully respected by public authorities. Political killings are non-existent.

3.8.1.3	Freedom from forced labor for men (C) (v2clslavem)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Are adult men free from servitude and other kinds of forced labor?
Clarification: Involuntary servitude occurs when an adult is unable to quit a job s/he desires to leave - not by reason of economic necessity but rather by reason of employer's coercion. This includes labor camps but not work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations such as conscription or employment in command economies.
Responses:
0: Male servitude or other kinds of forced labor is widespread and accepted (perhaps even organized) by the state.
1: Male servitude or other kinds of forced labor is substantial. Although officially opposed by the public authorities, the state is unwilling or unable to effectively contain the practice. 2: Male servitude or other kinds of forced labor exists but is not widespread and usually actively opposed by public authorities, or only tolerated in some particular areas or among particular social groups.
3: Male servitude or other kinds of forced labor is infrequent and only found in the criminal underground. It is actively and sincerely opposed by the public authorities. 4: Male servitude or other kinds of forced labor is virtually non-existent.

Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton, Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Are adult women free from servitude and other kinds of forced labor?
Clarification: Involuntary servitude occurs when an adult is unable to quit a job s/he desires to leave - not by reason of economic necessity but rather by reason of employer's coercion. This includes labor camps but not work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations such as conscription or employment in command economies.
This question does not ask you to assess the relative freedom of men and women from forced labor. Thus, a country in which both men and women suffer the same conditions of servitude might be coded a (0) for women, even though there is equality across the sexes.
Responses:
0: Female servitude or other kinds of forced labor is widespread and accepted (perhaps even organized) by the state.
1: Female servitude or other kinds of forced labor is substantial. Although officially opposed
by the public authorities, the state is unwilling or unable to effectively contain the practice. 2: Female servitude or other kinds of forced labor exists but is not widespread and usually actively opposed by public authorities, or only tolerated in some particular areas or among particular social groups.
3: Female servitude or other kinds of forced labor is infrequent and only found in the criminal underground. It is actively and sincerely opposed by the public authorities. 4: Female servitude or other kinds of forced labor is virtually non-existent.

Question: Are the laws of the land clear, well publicized, coherent (consistent with each other), relatively stable from year to year, and enforced in a predictable manner?
Clarification: This question focuses on the transparency and predictability of the laws of the land.
Responses:
0: Transparency and predictability are almost non-existent. The laws of the land are created and/or enforced in completely arbitrary fashion.
1: Transparency and predictability are severely limited. The laws of the land are more often than not created and/or enforced in arbitrary fashion.
2: Transparency and predictability are somewhat limited. The laws of the land are mostly created in a non-arbitrary fashion but enforcement is rather arbitrary in some parts of the country.
3: Transparency and predictability are fairly strong. The laws of the land are usually created and enforced in a non-arbitrary fashion.

Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Are public officials rigorous and impartial in the performance of their duties?
Clarification: This question focuses on the extent to which public officials generally abide by the law and treat like cases alike, or conversely, the extent to which public administration is characterized by arbitrariness and biases (i.e., nepotism, cronyism, or discrimination).
The question covers the public officials that handle the cases of ordinary people. If no functioning public administration exists, the lowest score (0) applies.
Responses:
0: The law is not respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is rampant.
1: The law is weakly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is widespread.
2: The law is modestly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is moderate.
3: The law is mostly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is limited.
4: The law is generally fully respected by the public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is very limited.

Clarification: This question specifies the extent to which men can bring cases before the courts without risk to their personal safety, trials are fair, and men have effective ability to seek redress if public authorities violate their rights, including the rights to counsel, defense, and appeal.
This question does not ask you to assess the relative access to justice men and women. Thus, it is possible to assign the lowest possible score to a country even if men and women enjoy equal - and extremely limited - access to justice.
Responses:
0: Secure and effective access to justice for men is non-existent.
1: Secure and effective access to justice for men is usually not established or widely respected. 2: Secure and effective access to justice for men is inconsistently observed. Minor problems characterize most cases or occur rather unevenly across different parts of the country.
3: Secure and effective access to justice for men is usually observed.
4: Secure and effective access to justice for men is almost always observed.

Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Are men able to openly discuss political issues in private homes and in public spaces?
Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which men are able to engage in private discussions, particularly on political issues, in private homes and public spaces (restaurants, public transportation, sports events, work etc.) without fear of harassment by other members of the polity or the public authorities. We are interested in restrictions by the government and its agents but also cultural restrictions or customary laws that are enforced by other members of the polity, sometimes in informal ways.
This question does not ask you to assess the relative freedom of men and women. Thus, it is possible to assign the lowest possible score to a country even if men and women enjoy equal - and extremely low - rights to freedom of discussion.
Responses:
0: Not respected. Hardly any freedom of expression exists for men. Men are subject to immediate and harsh intervention and harassment for expression of political opinion. 1: Weakly respected. Expressions of political opinions by men are frequently exposed to intervention and harassment.
2: Somewhat respected. Expressions of political opinions by men are occasionally exposed to intervention and harassment.
3: Mostly respected. There are minor restraints on the freedom of expression in the private sphere, predominantly limited to a few isolated cases or only linked to soft sanctions. But as a rule there is no intervention or harassment if men make political statements.
4: Fully respected. Freedom of speech for men in their homes and in public spaces is not restricted.

Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which individuals and groups have the right to choose a religion, change their religion, and practice that religion in private or in public as well as to proselytize peacefully without being subject to restrictions by public authorities.
Responses:
0: Not respected by public authorities. Hardly any freedom of religion exists. Any kind of religious practice is outlawed or at least controlled by the government to the extent that religious leaders are appointed by and subjected to public authorities, who control the activities of religious communities in some detail.
1: Weakly respected by public authorities. Some elements of autonomous organized religious practices exist and are officially recognized. But significant religious communities are repressed, prohibited, or systematically disabled, voluntary conversions are restricted, and instances of discrimination or intimidation of individuals or groups due to their religion are common.
2: Somewhat respected by public authorities. Autonomous organized religious practices exist and are officially recognized. Yet, minor religious communities are repressed, prohibited, or systematically disabled, and/or instances of discrimination or intimidation of individuals or groups due to their religion occur occasionally.
3: Mostly respected by public authorities. There are minor restrictions on the freedom of religion, predominantly limited to a few isolated cases. Minority religions face denial of registration, hindrance of foreign missionaries from entering the country, restrictions against proselytizing, or hindrance to access to or construction of places of worship.
4: Fully respected by public authorities. The population enjoys the right to practice any religious belief they choose. Religious groups may organize, select, and train personnel; solicit and receive contributions; publish; and engage in consultations without undue interference. If religious communities have to register, public authorities do not abuse the process to discriminate against a religion and do not constrain the right to worship before registration.

Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which citizens are able to travel freely to and from the country and to emigrate without being subject to restrictions by public authorities.
Responses:
0: Not respected by public authorities. Citizens are rarely allowed to emigrate or travel out of the country. Transgressors (or their families) are severely punished. People discredited by the public authorities are routinely exiled or prohibited from traveling.
1: Weakly respected by public authorities. The public authorities systematically restrict the right to travel, especially for political opponents or particular social groups. This can take the form of general restrictions on the duration of stays abroad or delays/refusals of visas.
2: Somewhat respected by the public authorities. The right to travel for leading political opponents or particular social groups is occasionally restricted but ordinary citizens only met minor restrictions.
3: Mostly respected by public authorities. Limitations on freedom of movement and residence are not directed at political opponents but minor restrictions exist. For example, exit visas may be required and citizens may be prohibited from traveling outside the country when accompanied by other members of their family.
4: Fully respected by the government. The freedom of citizens to travel from and to the country, and to emigrate and repatriate, is not restricted by public authorities.

3.8.3.6	Freedom of domestic movement for men (C) (v2cldmovem)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Do men enjoy freedom of movement within the country?
Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which all men are able to move freely, in daytime and nighttime, in public thoroughfares, across regions within a country, and to establish permanent residency where they wish. Note that restrictions in movement might be imposed by the state and/or by informal norms and practices. Such restrictions sometimes fall on rural residents, on specific social groups, or on dissidents.
This question does not ask you to assess the relative freedom of men and women. Thus, it is possible to assign the lowest possible score to a country even if men and women enjoy equal - and extremely low - freedom of movement.
Do not consider restrictions in movement that are placed on ordinary (non-political) criminals. Do not consider restrictions in movement that result from crime or unrest.
Responses:
0: Virtually no men enjoy full freedom of movement (e.g., North Korea).
1: Some men enjoy full freedom of movement, but most do not (e.g., Apartheid South Africa). 2: Most men enjoy some freedom of movement but a sizeable minority does not. Alternatively all men enjoy partial freedom of movement.
3: Most men enjoy full freedom of movement but a small minority does not. 4: Virtually all men enjoy full freedom of movement.

Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Does the state own or directly control important sectors of the economy?
Clarification: This question gauges the degree to which the state owns and controls capital (including land) in the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors.
It does not measure the extent of government revenue and expenditure as a share of total output; indeed, it is quite common for states with expansive fiscal policies to exercise little direct control (and virtually no ownership) over the economy.
Responses:
0: Virtually all valuable capital belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state.
Private property may be officially prohibited.
1: Most valuable capital either belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state. 2: Many sectors of the economy either belong to the state or are directly controlled by the state, but others remain relatively free of direct state control.
3: Some valuable capital either belongs to the state or is directly controlled by the state, but most remains free of direct state control.

Clarification: Private property includes the right to acquire, possess, inherit, and sell private property, including land. Limits on property rights may come from the state (which may legally limit rights or fail to enforce them); customary laws and practices; or religious or social norms. This question concerns the right to private property, not actual ownership of property. This question does not ask you to assess the relative rights of men and women. Thus, it is possible to assign the lowest possible score to a country even if men and women enjoy equal - and very minimal - property rights.
Responses:

1: Some men enjoy some private property rights, but most have none.
2: Many men enjoy many private property rights, but a smaller proportion enjoys few or none. 3: More than half of men enjoy most private property rights, yet a smaller share of men have much more restricted rights.

3.9 Sovereignty/State
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Sovereignty: This section addresses a number of issues concerning the sovereignty of the state. A state is political organization that organizes compulsory domination over a fixed territory on a continual basis. With respect to state sovereignty, we are interested in measuring two distinct areas of sovereignty. The first is an attribute of states within the context of the international system. Here, we are interested in the state's autonomy from other actors in the system. The second component of sovereignty concerns the relationship of the state to the population and territory over which it claims to rule. Here, we want to gauge the extent of recognition of the preeminent authority of the state over its claimed territory and population.

3.9.0.1	Domestic autonomy (C) (v2svdomaut)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is the state autonomous from the control of other states with respect to the conduct of domestic policy?
Clarification: The question of domestic autonomy does not include restrictions emanating from treaties (e.g., NATO), international organizations (e.g., the WTO), or confederations (e.g., the European Union) if these agreements are freely negotiated by the state and if the state is free to exit from that treaty, organization, or confederation. Nor does it include restrictions on policymaking emanating from international market forces and trans-national corporations.
Responses:
0: Non-autonomous. National level authority is exercised by an external power, either by
law or in practice. The most common examples of this are direct colonial rule and military occupation (e.g. quadripartite occupation of Germany in 1945). It also includes situations in which domestic actors provide de jure cover for de facto control by a foreign power (e.g. Vichy France). However, control of some part of the territory of a state by an enemy during war is not considered control by external actors if the sovereign government remains on scene and continues to wage conventional war (e.g., the USSR during WW II).
1: Semi-autonomous. An external political actor directly constrains the ability of domestic actors to rule, decides who can or cannot rule through formal rules or informal understandings, or precludes certain policies through explicit treaty provisions or well-understood rules of the game from which the subject state cannot withdraw. Examples include Soviet "satellite" states in Eastern Europe, and situations where colonial powers grant limited powers of national selfgovernment to their possessions (e.g., protectorates and limited home government). 2: Autonomous. Domestic political actors exercise political authority free of the direct control of external political actors.

3.9.0.2	International autonomy (C) (v2svinlaut)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is the state autonomous from the control of other states with respect to the conduct of its foreign policy?
Responses:
0: Non-autonomous. Foreign policy is controlled by an external power, either de facto or de jure. The most common examples of this are colonial rule and military occupation (e.g. quadripartite occupation of Germany in 1945). Situations in which domestic actors provide de jure cover for de facto control by a foreign power should not be construed as semi-autonomy (e.g. Vichy France). Governments in exile that control underground forces waging unconventional warfare are not considered as mitigating an occupation regime (e.g. countries under German occupation during WWII).
1: Semi-autonomous. An external political actor directly constrains the ability of domestic actors to pursue an independent foreign policy course in some important areas. This may be the product of explicit treaty provisions or well-understood rules of the game from which the subject state cannot withdraw. Examples would include Soviet strictures over rule in so-called "satellite" states in Eastern Europe, and explicitly negotiated postwar settlements (e.g. Austria following WWII).
2: Autonomous. Domestic political actors exercise foreign policy free of the direct control of external political actors. Direct control is meant to exclude the exercise of constraint or the impact of interdependence in the international system. Treaties in which states concede some part of that control to a supra- or international organization voluntarily, and from which there is a possibility of exit should not be interpreted as a violation of autonomy.

3.9.0.3	State authority over territory (C) (v2svstterr)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Over what percentage (%) of the territory does the state have effective control?
Clarification: With this question we seek to judge the extent of recognition of the preeminent authority of the state over its territory. We are not interested here in perfect control by the state, or whether it is relatively effective in comparison to other states, but an assessment of the areas over which it is hegemonic, e.g. where it is recognized as the preeminent authority and in a contest of wills it can assert its control over political forces that reject its authority. Several illustrative examples may help in this coding. During civil wars the claim of the state to rule is effectively neutralized by insurgent groups (e.g., the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka). There are also situations in which criminals or warlords exert control in contravention of state authority (e.g. opium growers in parts of Indochina). There are also cases of failed states where the central government cannot assert control over a share of its territory (e.g., contemporary Somalia). Here, we ask you to estimate the size of the territory that the state has effective control over, as a percentage (%) of the total territory that is officially part of the country.
By "officially part of the country" we refer to international law. In cases where international law is not entirely clear, we refer you to general understandings. For example, China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but it remains under the control of its own government. For purposes of this question, Taiwan should not be considered a failure to control its territory by the government of the PRC.

Question: On which of the following sources of revenue does the central government primarily rely to finance its activities?
Responses:
0: The state is not capable of raising revenue to finance itself.
1: The state primarily relies on external sources of funding (loans and foreign aid) to finance its activities.
2: The state primarily relies on directly controlling economic assets (natural resource rents, public monopolies, and the expropriation of assets within and outside the country) to finance its activities.
3: The state primarily relies on taxes on property (land taxes) and trade (customs duties). 4: The state primarily relies on taxes on economic transactions (such as sales taxes) and/or taxes on income, corporate profits and capital.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: To what extent are state administrators salaried employees?
Clarification: A state administrator is anyone who works for the state administration. By "salaried employee", we mean someone who is employed on a contract and paid a regular allowance directly out of the state coffers. It does not include unpaid work; work paid for through a private collection of fees, material perquisites or bribes; private employment by a higherranking "patron" within the administration; contractors being paid on an irregular basis; or "parastatals" (those working for state-owned companies), since the latter are not paid directly out of the state coffers. Note that the question refers to the practices obtaining in the state administration, excluding the armed forces.
Responses:
0: None or almost none are salaried state employees.

3.9.0.9	Independent states (A) (v2svindep)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning, Michael Bernhard Question: Is the polity an independent state?
Clarification: We use Gleditsch and Ward's (1999) coding of independent states. Their definition recognizes that listing independent states relies at least in part on subjective evaluations. A state is considered to be an independent polity if it (a) has a relatively autonomous administration over some territory, (b) is considered a distinct entity by local actors or the state it is dependent on. Polities excluded from the list are: colonies; states that have some form of limited autonomy (e.g. Scotland); are alleged to be independent but are contiguous to the dominant entity (Ukraine and Belarus prior to 1991); de facto independent polities but recognized by at most one other state (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus). Occupations or foreign rule are considered to be an actual loss of statehood when they extend beyond a decade. This means that cases such as the Baltic Republic during Soviet occupation are not considered independent states, but independent statehood is retained for European countries occupied during World War II.

0: No
1: Yes

3.10 Civil Society
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Civil society organization: The following set of questions focus on civil society organizations (CSOs). These include interest groups, labor unions, religiously inspired organizations (if they are engaged in civic or political activities), social movements, professional associations, and classic nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), but not businesses, political parties, government agencies, or religious organizations that are primarily focused on spiritual practices. A CSO must also be at least nominally independent of government and economic institutions.

If no CSOs exist at all for a particular time period, code the following relevant questions as giving the "lowest score" (indicating, for instance, strong repression or no consultation, a 0).
Religious organizations:	In this section, we ask two questions regarding religious organizations. These may be religiously inspired civil society organizations (CSOs) or organizations whose purpose is primarily spiritual.
3.10.0.1	CSO entry and exit (C) (v2cseeorgs)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent does the government achieve control over entry and exit by civil society organizations (CSOs) into public life?
Responses:
0: Monopolistic control. The government exercises an explicit monopoly over CSOs. The only organizations allowed to engage in political activity such as endorsing parties or politicians, sponsoring public issues forums, organizing rallies or demonstrations, engaging in strikes, or publicly commenting on public officials and policies are government-sponsored organizations. The government actively represses those who attempt to defy its monopoly on political activity.
1: Substantial control. The government licenses all CSOs and uses political criteria to bar organizations that are likely to oppose the government. There are at least some citizen-based organizations that play a limited role in politics independent of the government. The government actively represses those who attempt to flout its political criteria and bars them from any political activity.
2: Moderate control. Whether the government ban on independent CSOs is partial or full, some prohibited organizations manage to play an active political role. Despite its ban on organizations of this sort, the government does not or cannot repress them, due to either its weakness or political expedience.
3: Minimal control. Whether or not the government licenses CSOs, there exist constitutional provisions that allow the government to ban organizations or movements that have a history of anti-democratic action in the past (e.g. the banning of neo-fascist or communist organizations in the Federal Republic of Germany). Such banning takes place under strict rule of law and conditions of judicial independence.
4: Unconstrained. Whether or not the government licenses CSOs, the government does not impede their formation and operation unless they are engaged in activities to violently overthrow the government.

Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Does the government attempt to repress civil society organizations (CSOs)?
Responses:
0: Severely. The government violently and actively pursues all real and even some imagined members of CSOs. They seek not only to deter the activity of such groups but to effectively liquidate them. Examples include Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China.
1: Substantially. In addition to the kinds of harassment outlined in responses 2 and 3 below, the government also arrests, tries, and imprisons leaders of and participants in oppositional CSOs who have acted lawfully. Other sanctions include disruption of public gatherings and violent sanctions of activists (beatings, threats to families, destruction of valuable property). Examples include Mugabe's Zimbabwe, Poland under Martial Law, Serbia under Milosevic. 2: Moderately. In addition to material sanctions outlined in response 3 below, the government also engages in minor legal harassment (detentions, short-term incarceration) to dissuade CSOs from acting or expressing themselves. The government may also restrict the scope of their actions through measures that restrict association of civil society organizations with each other or political parties, bar civil society organizations from taking certain actions, or block international contacts. Examples include post-Martial Law Poland, Brazil in the early 1980s, the late Franco period in Spain.
3: Weakly. The government uses material sanctions (fines, firings, denial of social services) to deter oppositional CSOs from acting or expressing themselves. They may also use burdensome registration or incorporation procedures to slow the formation of new civil society organizations and sidetrack them from engagement. The government may also organize Government Organized Movements or NGOs (GONGOs) to crowd out independent organizations. One example would be Singapore in the post-Yew phase or Putin's Russia. 4: No. Civil society organizations are free to organize, associate, strike, express themselves, and to criticize the government without fear of government sanctions or harassment.

3.10.0.3	CSO consultation (C) (v2cscnsult)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Are major civil society organizations (CSOs) routinely consulted by policymakers on policies relevant to their members?
Responses:
0: No. There is a high degree of insulation of the government from CSO input. The government may sometimes enlist or mobilize CSOs after policies are adopted to sell them to the public at large. But it does not often consult with them in formulating policies.
1: To some degree. CSOs are but one set of voices that policymakers sometimes take into account.
2: Yes. Important CSOs are recognized as stakeholders in important policy areas and given voice on such issues. This can be accomplished through formal corporatist arrangements or through less formal arrangements.

Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Civil societies inevitably involve a mix of larger and smaller organizations. Please characterize the relative influence of large mass constituency civil society organizations (CSOs) versus smaller, more local, or narrowly construed CSOs.
Responses:
0: The state does not allow autonomous CSOs. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csstruc_0]
1: Large encompassing organizations dominate. The government and CSOs are linked formally through a corporatist system of interest intermediation; or, due to historical circumstances, particular large CSOs are highly influential. The voice of such organizations is recognized by the government and is accorded special weight by policymakers. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csstruc_1]
2: Neither large encompassing nor small CSOs dominate. Influence is contingent on circumstances. Organizations, both large and small, contend with one another to have their voice considered by policymakers. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csstruc_2]
    3: Small CSOs dominate. Many small organizations contend with one another to have their voices heard by policymakers. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csstruc_3] Scale: Series of dichotomous scales.

1: Voluntary CSOs exist but few people are active in them.
2: There are many diverse CSOs, but popular involvement is minimal.
3: There are many diverse CSOs and it is considered normal for people to be at least occasionally active in at least one of them.

Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Among civil society organizations, are there anti-system opposition movements?
Clarification: An anti-system opposition movement is any movement - peaceful or armed - that is based in the country (not abroad) and is organized in opposition to the current political system. That is, it aims to change the polity in fundamental ways, e.g., from democratic to autocratic (or vice-versa), from capitalist to communist (or vice-versa), from secular to fundamentalist (or vice-versa). This movement may be linked to a political party that competes in elections but it must also have a "movement" character, which is to say a mass base and an existence separate from normal electoral competition.
If there are several movements, please answer in a general way about the relationship of those movements to the regime.
Responses:
0: No, or very minimal. Anti-system movements are practically nonexistent.
1: There is only a low-level of anti-system movement activity but it does not pose much of a threat to the regime.
2: There is a modest level of anti-system movement activity, posing some threat to the regime. 3: There is a high level of anti-system movement activity, posing substantial threat to the regime.
4: There is a very high level of anti-system movement activity, posing a real and present threat to the regime.
Ordering: If coded "0", skip the following questions focused on anti-system movements.

3: Insurrectionary. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csanmvch_3]
4: Democratic. Perceived by most disinterested observers as willing to play by the rules of the democratic game, willing to respect constitutional provisions or electoral outcomes, and willing to relinquish power (under democratic auspices). (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2csanmvch_4] 5: Anti-democratic.

3.10.0.9	Religious organization repression (C) (v2csrlgrep)
Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Does the government attempt to repress religious organizations?
Responses:
0: Severely. The government violently and actively pursues all real and even some imagined members of religious organizations. It seeks not only to deter the activity of such groups but also to effectively liquidate them. Examples include Stalinist Russia and Maoist China.
1: Substantially. In addition to the kinds of harassment outlined in 2 and 3 below, the government also arrests, tries, and imprisons leaders of and participants in oppositional religious organizations who have acted lawfully. Other sanctions include disruption of public gatherings and violent sanctions of activists (beatings, threats to families, destruction of valuable property).
2: Moderately. In addition to material sanctions outlined in 3 below, the government also engages in minor legal harassment (detentions, short-term incarceration) to dissuade religious organizations from acting or expressing themselves. The government may also restrict the scope of their actions through measures that restrict association of religious civil society organizations with each other or political parties, bar religious civil society organizations from taking certain actions, or block international contacts.
3: Weakly. The government uses material sanctions (fines, firings, denial of social services) to deter oppositional religious organizations from acting or expressing themselves. They may also use burdensome registration or incorporation procedures to slow the formation of new religious civil society organizations and sidetrack them from engagement. The government may also organize parallel religious organizations to crowd out independent religious organizations.
4: No. Religious civil society organizations are free to organize, associate, strike, express themselves, and to criticize the government without fear of government sanctions or harassment.

3.11 The Media
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Media: Two types of media are distinguished in this section: (1) print (newspapers and magazines) and broadcast (radio and television), and (2) online media. We ask that you evaluate these categories as a whole. Thus, "the print and broadcast media" can provide a wide range of perspectives in a country even when individual publications or programs take a consistently narrow perspective.
Historical clarification: Two types of media are distinguished in this section: (1) print (newspapers and magazines) and (2) broadcast (radio) media. The latter is, however, only for reference to the contemporary era, and should of course be ignored before it appeared. But when applicable, we ask that you evaluate these categories as a whole. If there is no print or broadcast media at all in a given time period, leave the following questions blank (missing) for this time period. Please also explicitly note in the comments section at the end for which years there was no print or broadcast media at all.
3.11.0.1	Government censorship effort - Media (C) (v2mecenefm)
Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Does the government directly or indirectly attempt to censor the print or broadcast media?
Clarification: Indirect forms of censorship might include politically motivated awarding of broadcast frequencies, withdrawal of financial support, influence over printing facilities and distribution networks, selected distribution of advertising, onerous registration requirements, prohibitive tariffs, and bribery.
We are not concerned with censorship of non-political topics such as child pornography, statements offensive to a particular religion, or defamatory speech unless this sort of censorship is used as a pretext for censoring political speech.
Responses:
0: Attempts to censor are direct and routine.
1: Attempts to censor are indirect but nevertheless routine.
2: Attempts to censor are direct but limited to especially sensitive issues.
3: Attempts to censor are indirect and limited to especially sensitive issues.
4: The government rarely attempts to censor major media in any way, and when such exceptional attempts are discovered, the responsible officials are usually punished.

Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Does the government attempt to censor information (text, audio, or visuals) on the Internet?
Clarification: Censorship attempts include Internet filtering (blocking access to certain websites or browsers), denial-of-service attacks, and partial or total Internet shutdowns. We are not concerned with censorship of topics such as child pornography, highly classified information such as military or intelligence secrets, statements offensive to a particular religion, or defamatory speech unless this sort of censorship is used as a pretext for censoring political information or opinions. We are also not concerned with the extent of internet access, unless there is absolutely no access at all (in which case the coding should be 0).
Responses:
0 (1): The government successfully blocks Internet access except to sites that are pro-government or devoid of political content.
1 (2): The government attempts to block Internet access except to sites that are pro-government or devoid of political content, but many users are able to circumvent such controls.
2 (3): The government allows Internet access, including to some sites that are critical of the government, but blocks selected sites that deal with especially politically sensitive issues.
3 (4): The government allows Internet access that is unrestricted, with the exceptions mentioned above.

Responses:
0: No journalists dare to engage in journalistic activities that would offend powerful actors because harassment or worse would be certain to occur.
1: Some journalists occasionally offend powerful actors but they are almost always harassed or worse and eventually are forced to stop.
2: Some journalists who offend powerful actors are forced to stop but others manage to continue practicing journalism freely for long periods of time.
3: It is rare for any journalist to be harassed for offending powerful actors, and if this were to happen, those responsible for the harassment would be identified and punished.

Clarification: We ask you to take particular care in rating the year-to-year variation on this question if media bias tends to increase or decrease in election years. Coverage can be considered "more or less impartial" when the media as a whole present a mix of positive and negative coverage of each party or candidate.
Responses:
0: The print and broadcast media cover only the official party or candidates, or have no political coverage, or there are no opposition parties or candidates to cover.
1: The print and broadcast media cover more than just the official party or candidates but all the opposition parties or candidates receive only negative coverage.
2: The print and broadcast media cover some opposition parties or candidates more or less impartially, but they give only negative or no coverage to at least one newsworthy party or candidate.
3: The print and broadcast media cover opposition parties or candidates more or less impartially, but they give an exaggerated amount of coverage to the governing party or candidates.

1: Journalists, publishers, and broadcasters routinely alter news coverage in exchange for payments.
2: It is common, but not routine, for journalists, publishers, and broadcasters to alter news coverage in exchange for payments.
3: It is not normal for journalists, publishers, and broadcasters to alter news coverage in exchange for payments, but it happens occasionally, without anyone being punished. 4: Journalists, publishers, and broadcasters rarely alter news coverage in exchange for payments, and if it becomes known, someone is punished for it.

3.12 Political Equality
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Political Equality: This section pertains to political equality, that is, the extent to which members of a polity possess equal political power. It does not refer to the inevitable differentiation in power that occurs in all large societies between those who hold positions of power within the state (political elites) and lay citizens. It is, rather, about the distribution of political power among identifiable groups within the population.
What does it mean for a group of individuals to wield real political power? Although political power cannot be directly observed, one can infer that groups possess power to the extent that they: (a) actively participate in politics (by voting, etc.), (b) are involved in civil society organizations, (c) secure representation in government, (d) are able to set the political agenda, (e) influence political decisions, and (f) influence the implementation of those decisions. Please consider all these factors when answering the following questions. (Of course, the picture across these different dimensions may be mixed; your response should indicate the overall picture, taking all aspects of political power into account.)
3.12.0.1	Power distributed by socioeconomic position (C) (v2pepwrses)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is political power distributed according to socioeconomic position?
Clarification: All societies are characterized by some degree of economic (wealth and income) inequality. In some societies, income and wealth are distributed in a grossly unequal fashion. In others, the difference between rich and poor is not so great. Here, we are concerned not with the degree of social inequality but rather with the political effects of this inequality. Specifically, we are concerned with the extent to which wealth and income translates into political power.
Responses:
0: Wealthy people enjoy a virtual monopoly on political power. Average and poorer people have almost no influence.
1: Wealthy people enjoy a dominant hold on political power. People of average income have little say. Poorer people have essentially no influence.
2: Wealthy people have a very strong hold on political power. People of average or poorer income have some degree of influence but only on issues that matter less for wealthy people. 3: Wealthy people have more political power than others. But people of average income have almost as much influence and poor people also have a significant degree of political power. 4: Wealthy people have no more political power than those whose economic status is average or poor. Political power is more or less equally distributed across economic groups.

Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is political power distributed according to social groups?
Clarification: A social group is differentiated within a country by caste, ethnicity, language, race, region, religion, or some combination thereof. (It does not include identities grounded in sexual orientation or socioeconomic status.) Social group identity is contextually defined and
is likely to vary across countries and through time. Social group identities are also likely to cross-cut, so that a given person could be defined in multiple ways, i.e., as part of multiple groups. Nonetheless, at any given point in time there are social groups within a society that are understood - by those residing within that society - to be different, in ways that may be politically relevant.

0: Political power is monopolized by one social group comprising a minority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change. 1: Political power is monopolized by several social groups comprising a minority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change. 2: Political power is monopolized by several social groups comprising a majority of the population. This monopoly is institutionalized, i.e., not subject to frequent change.
3: Either all social groups possess some political power, with some groups having more power than others; or different social groups alternate in power, with one group controlling much of the political power for a period of time, followed by another - but all significant groups have a turn at the seat of power.
4: All social groups have roughly equal political power or there are no strong ethnic, caste, linguistic, racial, religious, or regional differences to speak of. Social group characteristics are not relevant to politics.

3.12.0.4	Power distributed by sexual orientation (C) (v2pepwrort)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent is political power distributed according to sexual orientation?
Clarification: This question contrasts (A) the political power of heterosexuals and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members of the polity who are not open about their sexuality with (B) the political power of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members of the polity who are open about their sexuality. (A) will be referred to as "heterosexual" and (B) as "LGBT."
Note that in comparing the political power of these two groups we are comparing their power per person. So, when we say that LGBT have less, equal, or more power than heterosexuals we mean relative to their share of the population (as near as this can be estimated).
Responses:
0: LGBTs are entirely excluded from the public sphere and thus deprived of any real political power (even though they may possess formal powers such as the ballot).
1: LGBTs have much less political power than heterosexuals. LGBTs enjoy formal rights to participate in politics but are subject to informal norms that often serve to exclude them from the halls of power.
2: LGBTs have somewhat less political power than heterosexual citizens.
3: LGBTs have about the same political power as heterosexuals. Each group enjoys a degree of political power that is roughly proportional to their population.
4: LGBTs enjoy somewhat more political power than heterosexuals by virtue of greater wealth, education, and high level of organization and mobilization.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent is high quality basic education guaranteed to all, sufficient to enable them to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens?
Clarification: Basic education refers to ages typically between 6 and 16 years of age but this varies slightly among countries.
Responses:
0: Extreme. Provision of high quality basic education is extremely unequal and at least 75 percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens.
1: Unequal. Provision of high quality basic education is extremely unequal and at least 25 percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens.
2: Somewhat equal. Basic education is relatively equal in quality but ten to 25 percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens.
3: Relatively equal. Basic education is overall equal in quality but five to ten percent (%) of children receive such low-quality education that probably undermines their ability to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens.

Question: To what extent is high quality basic healthcare guaranteed to all, sufficient to enable them to exercise their basic political rights as adult citizens?
Clarification: Poor-quality healthcare can make citizens unable to exercise their basic rights as adult citizens by failing to adequately treat preventable and treatable illnesses that render them unable to work, participate in social or political organizations, or vote (where voting is allowed).
Responses:
0: Extreme. Because of poor-quality healthcare, at least 75 percent (%) of citizens' ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined.
1: Unequal. Because of poor-quality healthcare, at least 25 percent (%) of citizens' ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined.
2: Somewhat equal. Because of poor-quality healthcare, ten to 25 percent (%) of citizens' ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined.
3: Relatively equal. Basic health care is overall equal in quality but because of poor-quality healthcare, five to ten percent (%) of citizens' ability to exercise their political rights as adult citizens is undermined.

3.13 Exclusion
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Exclusion: The following survey contains questions pertaining to exclusion. Political, economic and social well-being may depend on whether groups or individuals are excluded from positions of power, the state's protection of rights and freedoms, access to public goods and services, and opportunities to work or do business with the state.
Please bear in mind the following definitions as you respond to questions on this survey:
Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces based on their identity or belonging to a particular group. It is not necessary for all members of a group to be excluded in order for group-based exclusion to occur. Exclusion occurs even when only a single individual is excluded based on her or his identity or membership (perceived or actual) in a particular group.
Political groups are defined as those who are affiliated with a particular political party or candidate, or a group of parties/candidates. A common form of partisan exclusion is when state services or regulations are implemented in a way that seeks to reward the incumbent's political supporters and punish non-supporters.
Socio-Economic position defines groups based on attributes of wealth, occupation, or other economic circumstances such as owning property. Exclusion of economic groups occurs when, for example, those who are not property owners are restricted from voting, or when fees associated with justice, health or education are set at a rate that is unaffordable for poorer individuals.
Social group is differentiated within a country by caste, ethnicity, language, race, region, religion, migration status, or some combination thereof. (It does not include identities grounded in sexual orientation, gender, or socioeconomic status.) Social group identity is contextually defined and is likely to vary across countries and through time. Social group identities are also likely to cross-cut, so that a given person could be defined in multiple ways, i.e., as part of multiple groups. Nonetheless, at any given point in time there are social groups within a society that are understood - by those residing within that society - to be different, in ways that may be politically relevant. Contrast Identity group.
Geographic group refers to those living in rural or urban areas. Urban areas are defined as an area that meets the following conditions: population density exceeds a threshold of 150 persons per square kilometer and there is access to a sizeable settlement of 50,000 people or more within some reasonable travel time, for example 60 minutes by road. (World Development Report, 2009: 54).

(v2peapsecon)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is access to basic public services, such as order and security, primary education, clean water, and healthcare, distributed equally according to socioeconomic position?
Clarification: This question asks if socio-economic position is an important cleavage in society for the distribution of public services. Thus, if there are inequalities in access to public services, but these are not mainly due to differentiation between particular socio-economic position, the code should be "4" (equal). The situation could of course vary by type of public service, such that a socio-economic group is denied access to some basic public services but not others. Please base your response on whether access to most of the aforementioned services are distributed equally or unequally.
Responses:
0: Extreme. Because of poverty or low income, 75 percent (%) or more of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
1: Unequal. Because of poverty or low income, 25 percent (%) or more of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
2: Somewhat Equal. Because of poverty or low income, 10 to 25 percent (%) of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
3: Relatively Equal. Because of poverty or low income, 5 to 10 percent (%) of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.

3.13.3.5	Access	to	state	business	opportunities	by	urban-rural	location	(C)
(v2peasbegeo)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Are state business opportunities equally available to qualified individuals or firms regardless of their rural or urban locations?
Clarification: State business opportunities refer to the ability to compete for or receive a public procurement contract, to partner with the government in public-private partnerships, etc. Urban areas are defined as an area that meets the following conditions: population density exceeds a threshold of 150 persons per square kilometer, there is access to a sizeable settlement of 50,000 people or more within some reasonable travel time, for example 60 minutes by road. (World Development Report, 2009: 54)
Responses:
0: Extreme. Because they live in rural areas, 75 percent (%) or more of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.
1: Unequal. Because they live in rural areas, 25 percent (%) or more of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.
2: Somewhat Equal. Because they live in rural areas, 10 to 25 percent (%) of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.
3: Relatively Equal. Because they live in rural areas, 5 to 10 percent (%) of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.
4: Equal. Because they live in rural areas, less than 5 percent (%) of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.
5: Rural-Bias. Because they live in urban areas, 25 percent (%) of the population, even if qualified, lack access to state business opportunities.

3.13.4	Exclusion by Political Group
3.13.4.1	Political group equality in respect for civil liberties (C) (v2clpolcl)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Do members of all political groups enjoy the same level of civil liberties, or are some groups generally in a more favorable position?
Clarification: A political group is defined as those who are affiliated with a particular political party or candidate, or a group of parties/candidates that can be distinguished from others in terms of enjoyment of civil liberties. Responses should not reflect which party controls the legislature and executive. Here, civil liberties are understood to include access to justice, private property rights, freedom of movement, and freedom from forced labor.
Responses:
0: Some political groups enjoy much fewer civil liberties than other political groups.
1: Some political groups enjoy substantially fewer civil liberties than other political groups.
2: Some political groups enjoy moderately fewer civil liberties than other political groups.
3: Some political groups enjoy slightly fewer civil liberties than other political groups. 4: All political groups enjoy the same level of civil liberties.

Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is access to basic public services, such as order and security, primary education, clean water, and healthcare, distributed equally across political groups?
Clarification: A political group is defined as those who are affiliated with a particular political party or candidate, or a group of parties/candidates. This question asks if political group is an important cleavage in society for the distribution of public services. Thus, if there are inequalities in access to public services, but these are not mainly due to differentiation between particular political groups, the code should be "4" (equal). The situation could of course vary by type of public service, such that a political group is denied access to some basic public services but not others. Please base your response on whether access to most of the aforementioned services are distributed equally or unequally.
Responses:
0: Extreme. Because of their political group affiliation 75 percent (%) or more of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
1: Unequal. Because of their political group affiliation 25 percent (%) or more of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
2: Somewhat Equal. Because of their political group affiliation 10 to 25 percent (%) of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
3: Relatively Equal. Because of their political group affiliation only 5 to 10 percent (%) of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.
4: Equal. Because of their political group affiliation less than 5 percent (%) of the population lack access to basic public services of good quality.

3.14 Legitimation
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Legitimation strategies: Governments make legitimacy claims-provide justifications for the form of rule under which they govern. In the following section we are interested in the nature of the legitimacy claims made by the sitting government. Please note that the government's claims to legitimacy - their legitimation strategies - are the object of inquiry here. We are not asking you to assess how ordinary people judge the legitimacy of their rulers. Do not assume that governments make legitimacy claims on only one basis. We are interested in multi-track and hybrid legitimation strategies. The regime is understood as a set of formal and/or informal rules that govern the choice of political leaders and their exercise of power. The government is understood as the chief executive along with the cabinet, ministries, and top civil servants.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is society polarized into antagonistic, political camps?
Clarification: Here we refer to the extent to which political differences affect social relationships beyond political discussions. Societies are highly polarized if supporters of opposing political camps are reluctant to engage in friendly interactions, for example, in family functions, civic associations, their free time activities and workplaces
Responses:
0: Not at all. Supporters of opposing political camps generally interact in a friendly manner. 1: Mainly not. Supporters of opposing political camps are more likely to interact in a friendly than a hostile manner.
2: Somewhat. Supporters of opposing political camps are equally likely to interact in a friendly or hostile manner.

3.15.1.2	Political violence (C) (v2caviol)
Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How often have non-state actors used political violence against persons this year?
Clarification: We understand political violence as the use of physical force to achieve political objectives by non-state actors. The restriction to political objectives excludes profit-driven crime-related violence, for instance. By non-state actors we refer to individuals or entities that are not formally part of the state. Thus, politically oriented militias and youth groups count as non-state actors even though they might potentially be informally affiliated with the ruling party or the state. Political violence against persons excludes psychological and symbolic violence (e.g. destruction of objects).
Responses:
0: Not at all. Non-state actors did not use political violence.
1: Rare. Non-state actors rarely used political violence.
2: Occasionally. Non-state actors occasionally used political violence.
3: Frequently. Non-state actors frequently used political violence. 4: Often. Non-state actors often used political violence.

3.15.1.3	Freedom of peaceful assembly (C) (v2caassemb)
Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent do state authorities respect and protect the right of peaceful assembly?
Clarification: This question focuses on the ability to assemble publically in practice. An assembly is "an intentional and temporary presence of a number of individuals in a public place, for a common expressive purpose" (ODIHR and Venice Commission of the Council of Europe 2010). Authorities may limit the right to assembly only if limitations are necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, and are lawful, necessary, and proportionate to the aim pursued. Such reasonable and legal restrictions should not be considered when answering. However, if there is evidence that restrictions are used as a pretext for political reasons, this evidence should be considered.
Responses:
0: Never. State authorities do not allow peaceful assemblies and are willing to use lethal force to prevent them.
1: Rarely. State authorities rarely allow peaceful assemblies, but generally avoid using lethal force to prevent them.
2: Sometimes. State authorities sometimes allow peaceful assemblies, but often arbitrarily deny citizens the right to assemble peacefully.
3: Mostly. State authorities generally allow peaceful assemblies, but in rare cases arbitrarily deny citizens the right to assemble peacefully.
4: Almost always. State authorities almost always allow and actively protect peaceful assemblies except in rare cases of lawful, necessary, and proportionate limitations.

3.15.1.4	State of emergency (C) (v2casoe)
Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Was a national state of emergency in place at any point this year?
Clarification: A state of emergency is a formal legal act that enables state actors and institutions to change their roles during times of international or domestic crisis. Our definition of state of emergency includes the application of martial law. If there was more than one state of emergency, code the one that was in place for the longer time. Select one option.
Responses:
0: The legal framework does not allow for a declaration of a national state of emergency. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_0]
1: There was no state of emergency in place at any point this year, even though provisions for a declaration of a national state of emergency exist. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_1]
2: A national state of emergency was in place due to a natural disaster.	(0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_2]
3: A national state of emergency was in place due to a terrorist attack.	(0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_3]
4: A national state of emergency was in place due to an armed conflict/war, domestically or internationally. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_4]
5: A national state of emergency was in place due to mass protest/popular uprising. (0=No, 1=Yes) [v2casoe_5]

3.15.2	Mass Mobilization
  The following four questions concern the participation of citizens in events of political mass mobilization, such as demonstrations, strikes, protests, riots, and sit-ins.
  We first ask generally about participation in events of mass mobilization and then distinguish between mass mobilization for two different aims: democratic and autocratic.
  These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns stateorchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government).

Clarification: This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins. These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns state-orchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government).
Responses:
0: There have been virtually no events.
1: There have been several small-scale events.

Project Manager(s): Sebastian Hellmeier
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Were mass mobilization events concentrated in the capital?
Clarification: This question is about the geographic location of the events and not their intensity. In the unlikely event that no event at all took place, code option 2. This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins. These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns state-orchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government).

3.15.2.3	Mobilization for democracy (C) (v2cademmob)
Project Manager(s): Sebastian Hellmeier
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this year, how frequent and large have events of mass mobilization for pro-democratic aims been?
Clarification: Events are pro-democratic if they are organized with the explicit aim to advance and/or protect democratic institutions such as free and fair elections with multiple parties, and courts and parliaments; or if they are in support of civil liberties such as freedom of association and speech. This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes and sit-ins.
Responses:
0: There have been virtually no events.
1: There have been several small-scale events.
2: There have been many small-scale events.
3: There have been several large-scale and small-scale events. 4: There have been many large-scale and small-scale events.

Project Manager(s): Sebastian Hellmeier
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: In this year, how frequent and large have events of mass mobilization for pro-autocratic aims been?
Clarification: Events are pro-autocratic if they are organized explicitly in support of non-democratic rulers and forms of government such as a one-party state, monarchy, theocracy or military dictatorships. Events are also pro-autocratic if they are organized in support of leaders that question basic principles of democracy, or are generally are aiming to undermine democratic ideas and institutions such as the rule of law, free and fair elections, or media freedom. This question concerns the mobilization of citizens for mass events such as demonstrations, strikes, sit. These events are typically organized by non-state actors, but the question also concerns also count state-orchestrated rallies (e.g. to show support of an autocratic government).
Responses:
0: There have been virtually no events.
1: There have been several small-scale events.
2: There have been many small-scale events.

3.15.3	Citizen Engagement
  The following four questions concern citizen engagement in a variety of associations. We are not concerned with mere membership in such organizations, but with the extent to which citizens actively participate in such organizations. We consider an individual as active if they attend a meeting, activity or event at least twice a year.
  We distinguish between four types of associations. State-administered mass organizations are created and led by the government with compulsory or voluntary membership for specific societal groups. The other three types of associations-trade unions, political associations and non-political associations-are all independent from the state and membership is always voluntary.
3.15.3.1	Engagement in state-administered mass organizations (C) (v2castate)
Project Manager(s): Sebastian Hellmeier
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: What share of the population is regularly active in state-administered mass associations, such as women, worker or youth leagues?
Clarification: State-administered mass associations are civilian organizations created and led by the government or the ruling party. Large shares of specific societal groups are voluntary or compulsory members of these associations. Examples include youth leagues such as the Hitlerjugend in Nazi Germany and the pioneers in the Soviet Union, women leagues such as the Women's Federation in China or the Federacion de Mujeres Cubanas and official trade unions in the Soviet Union. Such organizations are formally or informally affiliated with the state and/or with the ruling party. We consider an individual as active if they attend a meeting, activity or event at least twice a year.
Responses:
0: Virtually no one.
1: A small share of the population (less than 5%).
2: A moderate share of the population (about 5 to 15 %).
3: A large share of the population (about 16 % to 25%).
4: A very large share of the population (about 26% or more).

Responses:
0: Virtually no one.
1: A small share of the population (less than 5%).

Question: What share of the population is regularly active in independent political interest associations, such as environmental associations, animal rights groups, or LGBT rights groups?
Clarification: Political associations include all associations whose main purpose is the change of policy or practice at the state or societal level. It does NOT include political parties or trade unions. An organization is independent if it is not controlled by the state or the ruling party and membership is voluntary. We consider an individual as active if they attend a meeting, activity or event at least twice a year.
Responses:
0: Virtually no one.
1: A small share of the population (less than 5%).

3.15.4	Academic Space
  University: "Universities" are all higher education institutions, both public and private. They include institutions such as research universities, universities of applied sciences, undergraduate colleges, polytechnic universities and international campuses.
  The questions in the following section ask you to generalize across universities in a particular country (and at a particular point in time). We realize that circumstances may vary between institutions and geographic regions. However, for our purposes it is important to consider what the prevailing practices and conditions are. Thus, when generalizing across diverse types of institutions, it is important to bear in mind their relative importance in the higher education sector of the country.
  Scholar: By "scholar" or "academic", we understand qualified researchers and lecturers affiliated with a university.
  Non-academic actor: By "non-academic actor", we mean individuals and groups that are not a scientifically trained university affiliate. Non-academic actors include individuals and groups such as politicians, party secretaries, externally appointed university management, businesses, foundations, other private funders, religious groups and advocacy groups.
  In some countries, the first university was only founded during the coding period (1900-2019). In this case, you will only be shown the coding grid starting with the first year of the existence of universities. If you have any corrections to this pre-coded data, please add them in the comments field below.
  In the event that all universities were closed down in a given year, please add a note in the comments field at the end of the section. Then assess the closure's impact on the academic space by following the indicators introduced below. The impact will differ depending on the reason for closure.
3.15.4.1	Existence of universities (A*) (v2cauni)
Project Manager(s): Alicja Polakiewicz, Janika Spannagel Question: Have universities existed in this country?

Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach, Ilyas Saliba, Janika Spannagel
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent are scholars free to develop and pursue their own research and teaching agendas without interference?
Clarification: Examples of interference include research agendas or teaching curricula being drafted, restricted, or fully censored by a non-academic actor; scholars being externally induced, through possible reprisals, to self-censor; or the university administration abusing its position of power to impose research or teaching agendas on individual academics. It also includes public pressure on academics - offline and online. We do not consider as interference restrictions that are due to research priorities, as well as ethical and quality standards, freely defined by the scholarly community as well as the development of standardized curricula by academics that aim to structure and enhance teaching.
Responses:
0: Completely restricted. When determining their research agenda or teaching curricula, scholars are, across all disciplines, consistently subject to interference or incentivized to self-censor.
1: Severely restricted. When determining their research agenda or teaching curricula, scholars are, in some disciplines, consistently subject to interference or incentivized to self-censor. 2: Moderately restricted. When determining their research agenda or teaching curricula, scholars are occasionally subject to interference or incentivized to self-censor.
3: Mostly free. When determining their research agenda or teaching curricula, scholars are rarely subject to interference or incentivized to self-censor.
4: Fully free. When determining their research agenda or teaching curricula, scholars are not subject to interference or incentivized to self-censor.

Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach, Ilyas Saliba, Janika Spannagel
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent are scholars free to exchange and communicate research ideas and findings?
Clarification: Free academic exchange includes uncensored access to research material, unhindered participation in national or international academic conferences, and the uncensored publication of academic material. Free dissemination refers to the unrestricted possibility for scholars to share and explain research findings in their field of expertise to non-academic audiences through media engagement or public lectures.
Responses:
0: Completely restricted. Academic exchange and dissemination is, across all disciplines, consistently subject to censorship, self-censorship or other restrictions.
1: Severely restricted. Academic exchange and dissemination is, in some disciplines, consistently subject to censorship, self-censorship or other restrictions.

3.15.4.6	Institutional autonomy (C) (v2cainsaut)
Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach, Ilyas Saliba, Janika Spannagel Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent do universities exercise institutional autonomy in practice?
Clarification: Institutional autonomy "means the independence of institutions of higher education from the State and all other forces of society, to make decisions regarding its internal government, finance, administration, and to establish its policies of education, research, extension work and other related activities" (Lima Declaration). Note that institutional autonomy does not preclude universities from accepting state or third party funding, but does require that they remain in charge of all types of decisions listed above. Institutional autonomy does also not preclude a public oversight role by the state over universities' spending of public funds.
Responses:
0: No autonomy at all. Universities do not exercise any degree of institutional autonomy; non-academic actors control decision-making.
1: Minimal autonomy. Universities exercise only very limited institutional autonomy; non-academic actors interfere extensively with decision-making.
2: Moderate autonomy. Universities exercise some institutional autonomy; non-academic actors interfere moderately with decision-making.
3: Substantial autonomy. Universities exercise institutional autonomy to a large extent; non-academic actors have only rare and minimal influence on decision-making.
4: Complete autonomy. Universities exercise complete institutional autonomy from non-academic actors.

Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach, Ilyas Saliba, Janika Spannagel
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent are campuses free from politically motivated surveillance or security infringements?
Clarification: "Campus" refers to all university buildings as well as digital research and teaching platforms. Campus integrity means the preservation of an open learning and research environment marked by an absence of an externally induced climate of insecurity or intimidation on campus. Examples of infringements of campus integrity are politically motivated on-campus or digital surveillance, presence by intelligence or security forces, presence of student militias, or violent attacks by third parties, if specifically targeting universities to repress academic life on campus. Note that we are only interested in politically motivated infringements and targeted attacks on campus integrity, not in non-political security concerns or proportionate security measures taken on campus to address these.
Responses:
0: Completely restricted. Campus integrity is fundamentally undermined by extensive surveillance and severe intimidation, including violence or closures.
1: Severely restricted. Campus integrity is to a large extent undermined by surveillance and intimidation, at times including violence or closures.
2: Moderately restricted. Campus integrity is challenged by some significant cases of surveillance or intimidation.
3: Mostly free. Campus integrity is to a large extent respected, with only minor cases of surveillance or intimidation.
4: Fully free. Campus integrity is comprehensively respected; there are no cases of surveillance or intimidation.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent do scholars and university students publicly criticize government policies?
Clarification: This question is only about the extent scholars and students actually criticize government policies - irrespective of how free they are to do so and whether they are met with repression or not. We ask you simply to consider to what extent scholars and students are noticeable as government critics in the public discourse.
Public criticism of government policies can be conveyed for example through the publication of op-eds or social media posts on current affairs, the signing of open letters or petitions, the taking part in or organization of public protests, or the holding of critical lectures to students or the public.
Responses:
0: Not at all. Scholars and university students do not publicly express criticism of government policies.
1: To a small extent. Scholars and university students publicly express minor criticism of government policies.
2: To a moderate extent. Scholars and university students publicly express moderate criticism of government policies.
3: To a large extent. Scholars and university students publicly express substantive criticism of government policies.
4: To a major extent. Scholars and university students publicly express fundamental criticism of government policies.

Question: Is the state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) without reservations to article 15 (right to science)?
Clarification: This indicator captures the country's international legal commitment to academic freedom. It indicates whether the country is party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights without having made explicit reservations to its article 15 (right to science), which stipulates, among other things, that states parties "undertake to respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research".
Responses:
0: State not a party to ICESCR, or made reservations to article 15.
1: State is party to ICESCR without reservations to article 15, but treaty not yet in force.

4 Historical V-Dem
This part of the codebook contains variables pertaining to the Historical V-Dem data collection. A maximum of 91 countries are included in the sample (see the country table), but some variables (in particular C type variables) cover fewer countries, as coding is still ongoing. For more information on the Historical V-Dem project, please refer to the Organization and Management document or the Historical V-Dem page. The vast majority of questions coded by Historical V-Dem are V-Dem indicators previously coded back to 1900, and these indicators are found in other sections of the codebook with merged time series extending all the way from 1789 to the present. In this part of the codebook, however, you will find the following types of variables, all of which have "v3" (rather than "v2") as the variable prefix:
1. Section 4.1-4.7: A number of new A, A* and C type indicators that have (at least so far) only been coded for Historical V-Dem, with the modal time series spanning the years 17891920 (although time series coverage is different for some variables). This section also includes v3elcomvot, which is coded as a type C variable in Historical V-Dem, while v2elcomvot is coded as a type A variable in Contemporary V-Dem.
2. Section 4.8: V-Dem indicators that are different to their contemporary counterparts, for the purpose of gathering additional relevant information for the historical period in Historical V-Dem. These variables are also merged into their v2 equivalents.
First, In contrast to contemporary V-Dem, Historical V-Dem codes upper chamber elections and thus also includes eltype category 2. Those observations are treated as missing in the historical-contemporary merged version of v2eltype. Due to election specific variables being cleaned by v2eltype, these do not include upper chamber elections either. In order to include historical data on upper chamber elections we thus also provide v3eltype and v3 election specific variables that are cleaned by v3eltype.
Second, Historical V-Dem codes additional chambers compared to contemporary V-Dem. When merging v2lgbicam and v3lgbicam the categories get recoded as follows:
- Categories 3 (tricameral) and 4 (quadricameral) become category 2 for the merged v2lgbicam.
- Category 9 (Other types of legislature) becomes category 0 for the merged v2lgbicam.
In order to include historical data on additional chambers, we thus also provide v3lgbicam and v3 chamber specific variables that are cleaned by v3lgbicam.
3. Section 4.9: Finally, the dataset includes A and A* variables where there is a discrepancy in the coding of some observations between the Historical and Contemporary V-Dem coding for the overlap period (typically 1900-1920). The v2-versions of these variables, reported elsewhere in the codebook, report the Contemporary V-Dem scores in cases of discrepancies in the overlap period.
Remaining inconsistencies in the Historical and Contemporary V-Dem coding, that are not due to substantive differences in the indicators, will be sorted out for version 10 of the dataset.
For instructions given to the coders (as shown in the surveys), please see introductions to the corresponding theme in section 3 (V-Dem Indicators).

4.1.12	Malapportionment legislature/lower chamber (C) (v3elmalalc)
Project Manager(s): Daniel Ziblatt
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is there a large discrepancy in the vote/seat ratio across electoral districts for the lower (or unicameral) chamber?
Clarification: "Malapportionment" characterizes a situation in which voters in some districts have more power by virtue of a more favorable vote/seat ratio. For example, if seats have not been reapportioned in a long time rural areas may be over-represented relative to urban areas simply because the latter have grown more rapidly than the former. (This question does not address inequality of votes based on class or other criteria.) Leave blank if there is no lower (or unicameral) chamber.
Responses:
0: There is a high degree of malapportionment. Vote/seat ratios across districts differ by as
much as 50:1.
1: There is a substantial degree of malapportionment. Vote/seat ratios across districts differ as much as 10:1.
2: There is some degree of malapportionment. Vote/seat ratios across districts differ by as much as 2:1.
3: There is modest or no malapportionment. Vote/seat ratios across districts differ by less than 2:1.

4.1.27	Suffrage exclusions (de jure) lower (unicameral) chamber (A) (v3elvstrlc)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: Is the right to vote for the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the national parliament restricted for any of the following reasons?
Clarification: This question applies to citizens only and to legal (de jure) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (de facto).
It applies to direct elections and not indirect elections (except situations where the electors are merely executing the will of the voters such as US presidential elections after 1800). If there is variation across regions of a country, for each category try to estimate the modal (most common) category. Thus, if most regions of a country imposed restrictions based on property, choose answer #2.
Leave blank if there is no lower (or unicameral) parliament.

4.1.28	Suffrage exclusions (de jure) presidential elections (A) (v3elvstrpr)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: Is the right to vote in the presidential election restricted for any of the following reasons? Check all that apply.
Clarification: This question applies to citizens only and to legal (de jure) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (de facto). Leave blank if the head of state is not directly elected. Specify in comments section if some of the criteria are jointly necessary (e.g., BOTH property AND literacy) or if some of them are mutually substitutable (e.g., EITHER property OR literacy).

4.1.29	Suffrage exclusions (de jure) upper chamber (A) (v3elvstruc)
Project Manager(s): Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: Is the right to vote for the upper house of the national parliament restricted for any of the following reasons? Check all that apply.
Clarification: This question applies to citizens only and to legal (de jure) restrictions, not restrictions that may be operative in practice (de facto). It applies to direct elections and not indirect elections (except situations where the electors are merely executing the will of the voters such as US presidential elections after 1800). If there is variation across regions of a country, for each category try to estimate the modal (most common) situation. Thus, if most regions imposed restrictions based on property, choose answer #2. Leave blank if there is no upper chamber or if upper chamber is not directly elected. Specify in comments section if some of the criteria are jointly necessary (e.g., BOTH property AND literacy) or if some of them are mutually substitutable (e.g., EITHER property OR literacy).

4.2 Political Parties
4.2.1	Party identification (C) (v3partyid)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Additional versions: *_nr
Question: Do voters identify with a political party?
Clarification: When party identification is strong, vote choice is largely determined by a voter's party affiliation (and his/her affiliation with that party) rather than attachments to particular candidates, non-partisan issue-positions, or material incentives (e.g., vote-buying). Likewise, when party identification is strong, voters retain loyalty to a single party rather than switching from one party to another across elections or across offices in the same election (ticket-splitting). In this fashion we can somewhat crudely distinguish between partisans and non-partisans. Note that this question refers only to voters, not to members of the population who do not vote (because they are disenfranchised, choose not to vote, or are discouraged from voting). Leave this question blank if there are no national elections.
Responses:
0: There are national elections, but there are no political parties.
1: Only one party is allowed to participate in national elections.
2: More than one party participates, and nearly all voters are non-partisans.
3: More than one party participates, and most voters are non-partisans.
4: More than one party participates, and voters are equally divided between partisans and non-partisans.
5: More than one party participates, and most voters are partisans.
6: More than one party participates, and nearly all voters are partisans.

Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: Is the lower chamber of the legislature required to approve the budget?
Clarification: The budget refers to major revenue (appropriations) and expenditure (spending) bills. Typically, these are passed annually or bi-annually. Approval is understood to mean a formal vote on the floor of the chamber in which at least 50% of those voting approve the measure.
Responses:
0: No. Includes situations in which (a) there are no formal budget bills, or (b) the executive entirely by-passes the lower house or ignores its actions.
    1: Yes. Includes situations in which (a) the executive exercises selective ("line-item") vetoes, and (b) there is a prolonged period in which no budget is passed and the executive is unable to raise and spend money, or must operate under the terms of the previous budget.

4.3.6	Lower chamber quota for social groups (A) (v3lgqumin)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: Is there a national-level quota for any social groups in the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature?
Clarification: These quotas are sometimes informally known as "minority quotas." Do not record gender quotas here (as gender is not part of what we mean by a social group). Also, do not include special rules that benefit parties defined by social group but do not guarantee seats for these groups. For example, do not count a rule exempting parties from threshold requirements.
Code "yes" only if the groups covered by the quota have full voting rights in the legislature.
Responses:
0: No national level quota for any social group.
1: Yes, there are reserved seats for at least one social group.

Clarification: Refers to actual practice not formal (de jure) rights. If practices vary across the country, or across sectors, please consider the overall situation of labor.
Responses:
0: Independent labor unions (free from state or ruling party control) are not allowed.
1: Independent labor unions are allowed, at least in some sectors of the economy or some sections of the country. However, they are subject to harassment by the police, paramilitary groups, business associations, or other groups. Harassment refers to systematic beatings, imprisonment, outlawing of specific unions, and other actions that seriously impinge upon the ability of unions to organize and bargain collectively.
2: Independent labor unions are allowed and they do not face violent repression but the legal climate is not friendly (e.g., "closed shop" rules are widespread), making it difficult to organize and bargain collectively.
3:	Independent labor unions are allowed and may organize freely in all sectors of the economy.

4.6 Sovereignty/State
4.6.1	Census (A) (v3stcensus)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell, Thomas Brambor, Agustín Goenaga, Johannes Lindvall Question: Was there a national census in this year?
Clarification: In order to count as a "census", the following four criteria needs to be satisfied: 1. UNIVERSALITY: the census attempted to cover the entire population and not just a sample.
2. INDIVIDUAL ENUMERATION: the census enumerates each individual separately andrecords his or her characteristics separately. If the census only produces aggregate or summarised information, it is only a population count and should not count as a census. For example, A population count of a household with 4 people would produce the following results:
Age-Adults: 2; Children: 2
Sex-Males: 2; Females: 2
Instead, an individual enumeration would look like this:
Head of household-male-adult
Spouse-female-adult
Son-male-child
Daughter-female-child
The key difference is that only in the individual enumeration the data on various characteristics can be cross-tabulated.
3. DEFINED TERRITORY: The territory covered, along with any changes in its area is clearly stated.
4. SIMULTANEITY AND SPECIFIED TIME: Each person is enumerated as nearly as possible to the same well-defined point in time, and the collected data should refer to a well-defined reference period.
Code "1" if a national census was completed in this year - but not if it was aborted or was not national in scope.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent are day-to-day decisions made by state administrators subject to intervention from political elites?
Clarification: By political elites we mean members of the executive, members of the legislature and political elites at local and regional levels. Note that the focus on the day-to-day decisions of the state administration implies interference in specific operational decisions in a meticulous manner. Decisions taken by rulers about the general direction of the state administration should not be considered. Note that the question refers to the de facto situation.
Responses:
0: Constantly. Day-to-day decisions taken by state administrators are constantly subject to intervention.
1: Often. Day-to-day decisions in the state administration are often subject to intervention. 2: About half. Approximately half of the day-to-day decisions in the state administration are subject to intervention.

Clarification: By "covered" we mean whether, based on the title of the yearbook, information about this year was included in a statistical yearbook. For example, if a yearbook was published in 1914, according to its title covering 1911-1914, then v3ststybpub should be coded as 1 for 1914 only, 0 for 1911-1913, but v3ststybcov as 1 for 1911-1914.

4.8 Historical V-Dem Modified
4.8.1	Lower chamber electoral system (A) (v3elloelsy)
Project Manager(s): Carl Henrik Knutsen
Question: What was the electoral system used in this election for the lower or unicameral chamber of the legislature?
Clarification: Further information on the following electoral system types can be found in Reynolds/Reilly, The New International IDEA Handbook (2005), chapter two and Annex B (Glossary of Terms) - downloadable, free of charge, at www.idea.int/publications/esd/.
Responses:
0: First-past-the-post (FPP, aka plurality) in single-member constituencies. The candidate with the most votes wins the seat.
1: Two-round system in single-member constituencies. Like FPP except that a threshold - usually 50% + 1 - is required to avoid a runoff between the two top vote-getters.
2: Alternative vote in single-member districts. Voters rank-order their preferences for the candidates who compete for a single seat. If any candidate receives an absolute majority of first preferences, s/he is elected. If not, then the least successful candidates (based on first-preferences) are eliminated and their votes reallocated to the second-preferences. This process is repeated until a candidate reaches 50% +1 of the votes.
3: Block vote in multi-member districts. Electors have as many votes as there are seats within that district and can rank-order them (within or across parties) as they please.
4: Party block vote in multi-member districts. Voters cast a vote for a single party (but not for individual candidates within the party's list). The party with the most votes (i.e., a plurality) wins all the seats in that district.
5: Parallel (SMD/PR). Some seats are in single-member districts (allocated by FPP or two-round electoral rules) and other seats are in multimember districts (allocated by some form of PR). These districts are overlapping, meaning that each elector votes twice: once in the single-member district race and once in the multi-member district race. Results are independent.
6: Mixed-member proportional (SMD with PR compensatory seats). Some seats are in single-member districts (allocated by FPP or two-round electoral rules) and other seats are in multimember districts (allocated by some form of PR). These districts are overlapping, meaning that each elector votes twice: once in the single-member district race and once in the multi-member district race. Results are not independent. Specifically, the multimember seats are used to rectify disproportionalities achieved in the single-member district election - by adding seats, as necessary. This means that the representation of parties in the legislature

is determined entirely by the PR ballot. It also means that the result of an MMP election is similar to the result of a PR election: parties achieve representation according to their nationwide vote share (on the PR ballot)
7: List PR with small multi-member districts (mean district size < 7). Each party presents a list of candidates for election within a district. Electors vote for a party, and parties receive seats in (rough) proportion to their overall share of the vote. Mean district size is less than seven.
8: List PR with large multi-member districts (mean district size > 7). Each party presents a list of candidates for election within a district. Electors vote for a party, and parties receive seats in (rough) proportion to their overall share of the vote. Mean district size is greater than seven.
9: Single-transferable vote (STV) in multi-member districts. Electors rank-order candidates nominated for a district. Candidates that surpass a specified quota of first-preference votes are elected. The remaining seats are chosen by reallocating the votes of the least successful candidates to elector's second- (or third-) preferences until the specified quota is reached. This process is repeated until all seats for that district are filled.
10: Single non-transferable vote (SNTV) in multi-member districts. Each elector chooses a single candidate. The candidates with the most votes (a plurality) win. (The number of winners is of course determined by the size of the district.)
11: Limited vote in multi-member districts.
Electors have more than one vote but fewer votes than the number of seats in the district. The candidates with the most votes (a plurality) win. (The number of winners is of course determined by the size of the district.)
12: Borda Count in single- or multi-member districts. Electors use numbers to mark preferences among candidates and each preference is assigned a value. For example, in a ten-candidate field a first preference is worth one, a second preference is worth .9, and so forth. These are summed and the candidate(s) with the highest total(s) is/are elected.

Responses:
0: No. The majority party or ruling coalition includes the same or substantially the same parties, even if some minor parties (holding less than 10 % of the seats in the legislature) left or joined the coalition, or because the elections do not affect the lower chamber.
1: Half. A minority party or coalition who was not in control of the chamber before the elections assumed the leading position in the legislature but is dependent on other parties for support. Or, a post-election ruling coalition includes some old parties and some new parties and the new parties represent more than 10 % of the seats in the legislature.
2: Yes. The incumbent party or coalition lost its majority or plurality-dominant position in the legislature and a different party or coalition assumes the majority position.

Question: What type of election was held on this date?
Clarification: The date and type of each election has been pre-coded. Any pre-coded years contain an orange triangle. This means that the score or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the pre-coded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for the same elections.
If the election unfolds across more than one day, the date for the first day is entered. If the precise date was unavailable, the first of the month is entered. If the month is unknown, January 1 is entered. Multiple-round elections (e.g., two-round elections) are counted separately, i.e., as separate elections. More than one election in a single year is accommodated by listing each election with a separate calendar date. When elections to more than one office occur on the same day these are listed separately (though naturally with the same date).

"Government offices" here refers to a local executive and a local assembly, not a judiciary and not minor bureaucrats. An executive is a single individual (or a very small group) (e.g., a mayor). An assembly is a larger body of officials.
"Elected" refers to offices that are directly elected by citizens or indirectly elected by a local elected assembly. All other methods of obtaining office - including appointment by a higher level of government - are considered to be non-elected.
In classifying a position as elected one is making no judgments about the freeness/fairness of the election or the relative extent of suffrage. One is simply indicating that there is an election and that the winner of that election (however conducted) generally takes office.

Local government refers to the level of government below the regional government. There are many names for units at this level; some common ones are counties, communes, cities, municipalities, towns, rural municipalities, and villages.
Countries with more than two subnational levels may have multiple levels that fit the definition of local government.

Regional government is typically the second-highest level of government, just below the national government. There are many names for units at this level; some common ones are regions, provinces, states, departments, and cantons.
Countries with more than two subnational levels may have multiple levels that fit the definition of regional government. If this is the case, for all questions about regional government please code the regional level that, in practice, has the most responsibilities (e.g. making laws, providing primary, education, maintaining roads, policing, etc.) and resources to carry out those responsibilities.
Some countries are so small that, now or in earlier time periods, they have only local government and not regional government. If this is the case, this question is coded as "0" for the appropriate time period.
Responses:
0: No
1: Yes
Ordering: If coded "0" for entire period, skip the following questions focused on regional government.

"Government offices" here refers to a regional executive and a regional assembly, not a judiciary and not minor bureaucrats. An executive is a single individual (or a very small group) (e.g., a governor). An assembly is a larger body of officials, who may be divided into two chambers. "Elected" refers to offices that are directly elected by citizens or indirectly elected by a regional elected assembly. All other methods of obtaining office - including appointment by higher or lower levels of government - are considered to be non-elected.
In classifying a position as elected one is making no judgments about the freeness/fairness of the election or the relative extent of suffrage. One is simply indicating that there is an election and that the winner of that election (however conducted) generally takes office.

Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: Is the head of state (HOS) also head of government (HOG)?
Clarification: Once again, the identities of the head of government for each country have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. Any pre-coded years contain an orange triangle. This means that either the score or text and/or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the pre-coded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for
the same executives.
Note that this question only pertains to whether the head of state and the head of government are the same person or body, regardless of the relative powers of the two. Thus, in a constitutional monarchy, for example, the head of state and head of government are not the same even though the head of state may lack any real political power. If multiple head of states/head of governments were appointed in any year, the question pertains to each one of them.
Responses:
0: No

4.9.9	HOG name (A*) (v3exnamhog)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: What is the name of the head of government?
Clarification: The identities of the head of government for each country have been pre-coded for as many years as possible. Any pre-coded years contain an orange triangle. This means that the text and/or specific date have already been entered, so we are asking you only to add your confidence in the pre-coded rating; we do not want you to change the rating, as we need all the Country Experts to answer the subsequent questions for the same executives.
Only heads of government in office for 100 or more days are listed. If the head of government is a collective body, the name provided is of the person exercising the most effective power within this body, or, if no such person exists, the expression "collective body" is used. If multiple heads of government were appointed in a given year, this question pertains to each one of them, including the specific date of appointment and reappointment for each one of them.

4.9.11	HOS appointment in practice (A) (v3expathhs)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: How did the head of state reach office?
Clarification: If several bodies were involved in the appointment process, select the one that exerted the most critical impact on the decision. However, in the next question we ask separately about whether the approval of the legislature was necessary. Response category 7 should only be selected if the head of state is directly elected, not if he or she was appointed by the legislature after an election.
Responses:
0: Through the threat of or application of force, such as a coup or rebellion.
1: Appointed by a foreign power.
2: Appointed by the ruling party (in a one-party system).
3: Appointed by a royal council.
4: Through hereditary succession.
5: Appointed by the military.
6: Appointed by the legislature.
7: Directly through a popular election (regardless of the extension of the suffrage). 8: Other.

5 Other Indices Created Using V-Dem Data
  This section includes indices created using V-Dem data but are not subcomponents of the V-Dem Democracy Indices presented in section 2.1. Please see Appendix A for an overview of all indices, component-indices, and lower-level indices.
5.1 Regimes of the World (RoW)
5.1.1	Regimes of the world - the RoW measure (D) (v2x_regime)
Project Manager(s): Marcus Tannenberg, Staffan I Lindberg
Question: How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of access to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles?
Responses:
0: Closed autocracy: No multiparty elections for the chief executive or the legislature.
1: Electoral autocracy: De-jure multiparty elections for the chief executive and the legislature, but failing to achieve that elections are free and fair, or de-facto multiparty, or a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites of polyarchy as measured by V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy).
2: Electoral democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy), but either access to justice, or transparent law enforcement, or liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive not satisfied as measured by V-Dem's Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal).
3: Liberal democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy) are guaranteed as well as access to justice, transparent law enforcement and the liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive satisfied as measured by V-Dem's Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal).
Scale: Ordinal.

Aggregation: Electoral democracies score above 2 on the indicators for multi-party (v2elmulpar_osp) and free and fair elections (v2elfrfair_osp), as well as above 0.5 on the
Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy). Liberal democracy meets the criteria for Electoral democracy but also satisfy the liberal dimensions by a score above 0.8 on the V-Dem Liberal Component index (v2x_liberal), as well as a score above 3 on transparent law enforcement (v2cltrnslw_osp), access to justice for men (v2clacjstm_osp) and women (v2clacjstw_osp). Electoral autocracies fail to meet one or more of the above-mentioned criteria of electoral democracies, but subject the chief executive and the legislature to de-jure multiparty elections as indicated by a score above 1 on the V-Dem multiparty elections indicator (v2elmulpar_osp). Closed autocracy if either no multiparty elections for the legislature take place (v2xlg_elecreg == 0) or the chief executive is not elected in direct or indirect multiparty elections. To identify whether this is the case, we take into account if there is no basic multiparty competition in elections (v2elmulpar_osp < 1) and the relative power of the Head of State (HoS) and the Head of Government (HoG) as well as the appointment procedures. The V-Dem variable v2ex_hosw identifies if the HoS (v2ex_hosw > 0.5) or HoG (v2ex_hosw < or equal to 0.5) is the chief executive. If the HoG is the chief executive, the variable v2expathhg indicates whether the HoG is directly (8) or indirectly (7) elected or appointed by the HoS (6). In the first case, we consider whether executive elections (v2xex_elecreg == 0) take place, in the second case whether legislative elections take place
5.1 Regimes of the World (RoW)
(v2xlg_elecreg == 0) and in the third case how HoS is selected as follows. The variable v2expathhs indicates whether the HoS is directly (7) or indirectly (6) elected. Thus, in the first case, we consider whether executive elections (v2xex_elecreg) take place, in the second case whether legislative elections take place and the legislature approves on HoG (v2xlg_elecreg == 0 and v2exaphog == 0). This also applies for the cases if the HoS is the chief executive.

5.1.2 Regimes of the world - the RoW measure with categories for ambiguous cases (D) (v2x_regime_amb)
Project Manager(s): Marcus Tannenberg, Staffan I Lindberg, Valeriya Mechkova
Question: How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of access to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles?
Responses:
0: Closed autocracy: No multiparty elections for the chief executive or the legislature.
1: Closed autocracy upper bound: Same as closed autocracy, but the confidence intervals of the multiparty election indicators overlap the level of electoral autocracies.
2: Electoral autocracy lower bound: Same as electoral autocracy, but the confidence intervals of one or both of the multiparty election indicators overlap the level of closed autocracies.
3: Electoral autocracy: De-jure multiparty elections for the chief executive and the legislature, but failing to achieve that elections are free and fair, or de-facto multiparty, or a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites of polyarchy as measured by V-Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy).
4: Electoral autocracy upper bound: Same as electoral autocracy, but the upper bounds of the confidence intervals of the indicators for free and fair and multiparty elections and the Electoral Democracy Index overlap the level of electoral democracies.
5: Electoral democracy lower bound: Same as electoral democracy, but the lower bounds of the confidence intervals of the indicators for free and fair, or multiparty or the Electoral Democracy Index overlap the level of electoral autocracies.
6: Electoral democracy: Free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy), but either access to justice, or transparent law enforcement, or liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive not satisfied as measured by V-Dem's Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal).
7: Electoral democracy upper bound: Same as electoral democracy, but the confidence intervals of the indicators for access to justice, and transparent law enforcement, and the liberal component index overlap the level of liberal democracies.
8: Liberal democracy lower bound: Same as liberal democracy, but the confidence intervals of the indicators for access to justice, and transparent law enforcement, and the liberal component index reaches the level of electoral democracies.
9: Liberal democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of Dahl's institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem's Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy) are guaranteed as well as access to justice, transparent law enforcement and the liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive satisfied as measured by V-Dem's Liberal Component Index (v2x_liberal).

5.2 Accountability
5.2.1	Accountability index (D) (v2x_accountability)
Project Manager(s): Kyle L. Marquardt and Valeriya Mechkova
Additional versions: *_osp, *_codelow, *_codehigh
Question: To what extent is the ideal of government accountability achieved?
Clarification: Government accountability is understood as constraints on the government's use of political power through requirements for justification for its actions and potential sanctions. We organize the sub-types of accountability spatially. Vertical accountability refers to the ability of a state's population to hold its government accountable through elections, horizontal accountability refers to checks and balances between institutions; and diagonal accountability captures oversight by civil society organizations and media activity.
Scale: We provide two versions of this index. The first is the normalized output from the the hierarchical latent variable analysis. It is on an unbounded interval scale. The second, denoted by *_osp, is a version of this output which we scale using a standard normal cumulative distribution function. It is thus scaled low to high (0-1).

Aggregation: To create an aggregate measure of accountability, we conduct a hierarchical analysis using all variables included in the three sub-indices of accountability: vertical (v2x_veracc), horizontal (v2x_horacc) and diagonal accountability (v2x_diagacc). This strategy assumes that overall accountability is a function of all variables included in each sub-index, though the sub-indices structure this relationship.
Citation: Lührmann et al. (2020); V-Dem Codebook (see suggested citation at the top of this document).
Years: 1900-2022
Convergence: All estimates of country-year overall accountability converged using standard VDem criteria. About 1.1% of the model parameters in the overall accountability index did not converge using the standard V-Dem criterion (R-hat < 1.01). However, all parameters converge using the more relaxed criterion of R-hat < 1.1.
5.2.2	Vertical accountability index (D) (v2x_veracc)
Project Manager(s): Kyle L. Marquardt and Valeriya Mechkova
Additional versions: *_osp, *_codelow, *_codehigh
Question: To what extent is the ideal of vertical government accountability achieved?
Clarification: Vertical accountability captures the extent to which citizens have the power to hold the government accountable. The mechanisms of vertical accountability include formal political participation on part of the citizens - such as being able to freely organize in political parties - and participate in free and fair elections, including for the chief executive.

Scale: We provide two versions of this index. The first is the normalized output from the the hierarchical latent variable analysis. It is on an unbounded interval scale. The second, denoted by *_osp, is a version of this output which we scale using a standard normal cumulative distribution function. It is thus scaled low to high (0-1).

Aggregation: Vertical accountability consists of two main components: elections and political parties. We operationalize electoral accountability with three components: 1) an aggregate measure the quality of elections; 2) the percent of enfranchised population and 3) whether the chief executive is directly or indirectly elected. We model non-electoral regimes as having no suffrage and the quality of elections as a function of having an electoral regime (v2x_elecreg). Quality of elections consists of seven variables measuring different aspects of national elections for the executive and legislature. Specifically, we include autonomy and capacity of the electoral management body (v2elembaut) and (v2elembcap); accuracy of the voter registry (v2elrgstry), intentional irregularities conducted by the government and opposition (v2elirreg); intimidation and harassment by the government and its agents (v2elintim); to what extent the elections were multi-party in practice (v2elmulpar); and an overall measure for the freedom and fairness of elections (v2elfrfair). This is a modified version of the V-Dem Clean elections index (v2xel_frefair). We added the variable v2elmulpar, which is theoretically important for accountability, and we removed v2elvotbuy and v2elpeace, as they have low loadings.
We measure suffrage as the percentage of people that have the legal right to vote (v2x_suffr) to proxy the inclusivity of the exercise of electoral accountability. To account for the differences between states which have an executive subject to elections, we include a dichotomous indicator of whether or not the head of the executive either the head of state or head of government - whoever has more relative power over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers as measured by v2ex_hosw is subjected to direct or indirect elections (v2expathhs v2ex_legconhos v2expathhg v2exaphogp).
The second form of vertical accountability focuses on political parties, which we model as a hierarchical node. This node includes variables that capture whether there are barriers to forming a party and how restrictive they are (v2psparban) and (v2psbars), as well as the degree to which opposition parties are independent of the ruling regime (v2psoppaut).

Years: 1900-2022
5.2.3	Diagonal accountability index (D) (v2x_diagacc)
Project Manager(s): Kyle L. Marquardt and Valeriya Mechkova
Additional versions: *_osp, *_codelow, *_codehigh
Question: To what extent is the ideal of diagonal government accountability achieved?
Clarification: Diagonal accountability covers the range of actions and mechanisms that citizens, civil society organizations CSOs, and an independent media can use to hold the government accountable. These mechanisms include using informal tools such as social mobilization and investigative journalism to enhance vertical and horizontal accountability.
Scale: We provide two versions of this index. The first is the normalized output from the the hierarchical latent variable analysis. It is on an unbounded interval scale. The second, denoted by *_osp, is a version of this output which we scale using a standard normal cumulative distribution function. It is thus scaled low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2mecenefm v2mecenefi v2meharjrn v2mecrit v2mebias v2merange v2meslfcen v2csprtcpt v2cseeorgs v2csreprss v2cldiscm v2cldiscw v2clacfree v2dlengage Data release: 7-13.
Aggregation: We model this form of accountability as a function of four hierarchical nodes: media freedom, civil society characteristics, freedom of expression, and the degree to which citizens are engaged in politics.
The media freedom node incorporates variables representing two broad dimensions. The first dimension regards the extent to which the government attempts to censor the media (v2mecenefm) and information on the Internet (v2mecenefi), as well as the extent to which government and other powerful actors harass journalists (v2meharjrn). The second dimension concerns the work of the media itself, namely the extent to which: the media criticizes the government at least occasionally (v2mecrit); there is bias against opposition candidates (v2mebias); the media offers a wide array of political perspectives in their coverage (v2merange); and there is self-censorship on salient issues for the government (v2meslfcen). The media freedom node is an expanded version of the V-Dem Alternative sources of information index (v2xme_altinf).
Finally, we use the components of the V-Dem core index of civil society to account for the opportunity of citizens to channel their interests and potentially oppose the government and its policies in an organized way through a robust, self-organized and autonomous civil society organizations. The indicators included in this node are: popular and voluntary participation in CSOs, (v2csprtcpt), government control to the entry and exit of CSOs into the public life, (v2cseeorgs), and government oppression of CSOs (v2csreprss).
The freedom of expression node incorporates variables regarding the degree to which men and women are free to discuss political issues without fear of harassment (v2cldiscm and v2cldiscw), as well as an indicator on the freedom of academic and cultural expression
(v2clacfree).
Finally, we incorporate a variable representing engaged society (v2dlengage), which gives information on the width and depth of public deliberations when important policy changes are being considered.

5.2.4	Horizontal accountability index (D) (v2x_horacc)
Project Manager(s): Kyle L. Marquardt and Valeriya Mechkova
Additional versions: *_osp, *_codelow, *_codehigh
Question: To what extent is the ideal of horizontal government accountability achieved?
Clarification: Horizontal accountability concerns the power of state institutions to oversee the government by demanding information, questioning officials and punishing improper behavior. This form of accountability ensures checks between institutions and prevents the abuse of power. The key agents in horizontal government accountability are: the legislature; the judiciary; and specific oversight agencies such as ombudsmen, prosecutor and comptroller generals.
Scale: We provide two versions of this index. The first is the normalized output from the the hierarchical latent variable analysis. It is on an unbounded interval scale. The second, denoted by *_osp, is a version of this output which we scale using a standard normal cumulative distribution function. It is thus scaled low to high (0-1).
Source(s): v2juhcind v2juncind v2juhccomp v2jucomp v2exrescon v2lgotovst v2lginvstp v2lgbicam v2lgqstexp
Data release: 7-13.
Aggregation: We capture the extent to which the judiciary, the legislature and other oversight agencies hold the government to account by modeling each of these factors as separate hierarchical nodes.
The judiciary node speaks to the degree to which members of the executive compromise horizontal accountability by "unlawfully encroaching" on the legitimate authority of the judiciary branch. To capture that we use the indicators from the V-Dem judicial constraints on the executive index (v2x_jucon).
To model the degree to which a legislature facilitates horizontal accountability we model whether or not a legislature exists a dichotomized version of v2lgbicam, and legislature activities as a function of this variable. The key function of a legislature in terms of
5.3 Executive Bases of Power
horizontal accountability is to scrutinize government officials' potential misconduct by demanding information for their policies and decisions, and taking specific actions in case of irregularities. We use as baseline the indicators from the V-Dem legislative constraints on the executive index (v2xlg_legcon): the degree to which: 1 the legislature routinely questions the executive (v2lgqstexp); and 2 a legislature is likely to investigate and produce a decision unfavorable to the executive, if the latter were engaged in an illegal or unethical activity (v2lginvstp). We exclude the legislature opposition parties (v2lgoppart) as this aspect is part of vertical accountability.
Finally, we include a variable regarding the degree to which other state bodies comptroller general, general prosecutor, or ombudsman are likely to investigate and report on potential illegal or unethical activities on part of the executive (v2lgotovst).

Question: To what extent is the power base of the chief executive' determined by the confidence of the legislature?
Clarification: Representing one of five regime dimensions, each of which may be more or less present in any given case, this index taps into the extent to which the dismissal of the chief executive depends on the confidence of the legislature.

Aggregation: The index is based on whether the "chief executive" can be dismissed by the legislature (without having to level accusations of unlawful activity and without the involvement of any other agency). In nominally dual systems, where the head of state (HOS) and the head of government (HOG) are not the same individual, we determine who is the "chief executive" by comparing HOS and HOG powers over the appointment and dismissal of cabinet ministers. We aggregate across the two executives by taking the average weighted by their relative powers over cabinet formation and dismissal.

5.4 Neopatrimonialism
5.4.1	Neopatrimonial Rule Index (D) (v2x_neopat)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is rule based on personal authority?
Clarification: Neopatrimonial rule reflects the idea that personalistic forms of authority pervade formal regime institutions (Clapham, 1985). According to Bratton and Van de Walle (1997) a neopatrimonialism regime is one that combines clientelistic political relationships, strong and unconstrained presidents and the use of public resources for political legitimation. The index is constructed using Bayesian Factor Analysis of 16 indicators representing these three concepts. The sixteen indicators are those included in the three sub-indices: Clientelism, Presidentialism and Regime Corruption. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

Aggregation: The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores = more neopatrimonialism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for vote buying (v2elvotbuy), particularistic vs. public goods (v2dlencmps), party linkages (v2psprlnks), executive respects constitution (v2exrescon), executive oversight (v2lgotovst), legislature controls resources (v2lgfunds), legislature investigates the executive in practice

Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent are politics based on clientelistic relationships?
Clarification: Clientelistic relationships include the targeted, contingent distribution of resources (goods, services, jobs, money, etc) in exchange for political support. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.

5.4.3	Presidentialism Index (D) (v2xnp_pres)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the regime characterized by presidentialism?
Clarification: Presidentialism means the "systemic concentration of political power in the hands of one individual who resists delegating all but the most trivial decision making tasks" (Bratton and Van de Walle, 1997: 63). It relates closely to V-Dem's index of Horizontal Accountability (v2x_horacc) but focuses more specifically on the extent to which the President is free from constraints by other institutions or actors. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.

Aggregation: The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores
5.5 Civil liberties
= more presidentialism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for executive respect for the constitution (v2exrescon), whether there are mechanisms for oversight of the executive other than the legislature (v2lgotovst). For legislative constraints, the index includes an indicator of whether the legislature controls its own resources (v2lgfunds) and investigates the executive in practice (v2lginvstp). There are four indicators of judicial constraints on the executive: high court independence (v2juhcind), lower court independence (v2jucnind), compliance with high court (v2juhccomp) and compliance with judiciary (v2jucomp). Finally, the index includes a measure of autonomy of the electoral management body (v2elembaut) that captures whether or not the President can influence its decisions and actions.

5.4.4	Regime corruption (D) (v2xnp_regcorr)
Project Manager(s): Rachel Sigman, Staffan Lindberg
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent do political actors use political office for private or political gain?
Clarification: In systems of neopatrimonial rule, politicians use their offices for private and/or political gain. This index relates closely to V-Dem's political corruption index (v2x_corr), but focuses on a more specific set of actors - those who occupy political offices - and a more specific set of corrupt acts that relate more closely to the conceptualization of corruption in literature on neopatrimonial rule. The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.

5.7 Corruption
5.7.1	Political corruption index (D) (v2x_corr)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd Question: How pervasive is political corruption?
Clarification: The directionality of the V-Dem corruption index runs from less corrupt to more corrupt unlike the other V-Dem variables that generally run from less democratic to more democratic situation. The corruption index includes measures of six distinct types of corruption that cover both different areas and levels of the polity realm, distinguishing between executive, legislative and judicial corruption. Within the executive realm, the measures also distinguish
5.7 Corruption
between corruption mostly pertaining to bribery and corruption due to embezzlement. Finally, they differentiate between corruption in the highest echelons of the executive at the level of the rulers/cabinet on the one hand, and in the public sector at large on the other. The measures thus tap into several distinguished types of corruption: both 'petty' and 'grand'; both bribery and theft; both corruption aimed and influencing law making and that affecting implementation.

Aggregation: The index is arrived at by taking the average of (a) public sector corruption index (v2x_pubcorr); (b) executive corruption index (v2x_execorr); (c) the indicator for legislative corruption (v2lgcrrpt); and (d) the indicator for judicial corruption (v2jucorrdc). In other words, these four different government spheres are weighted equally in the resulting index. We replace missing values for countries with no legislature by only taking the average of a, b and d.

5.7.2	Executive corruption index (D) (v2x_execorr)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: How routinely do members of the executive, or their agents grant favors in exchange for bribes, kickbacks, or other material inducements, and how often do they steal, embezzle, or misappropriate public funds or other state resources for personal or family use?
Clarification: The point estimates for this index have been reversed such that the directionality is opposite to the input variables. That is, lower scores indicate a normatively better situation (e.g. more democratic) and higher scores a normatively worse situation (e.g. less democratic). Note that this directionality is opposite of that of other V-Dem indices, which generally run from normatively worse to better.

5.8.1	Women political empowerment index (D) (v2x_gender)
Project Manager(s): Pamela Paxton
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd Question: How politically empowered are women?
Clarification: Women's political empowerment is defined as a process of increasing capacity for women, leading to greater choice, agency, and participation in societal decision-making. It is understood to incorporate three equally-weighted dimensions: fundamental civil liberties, women's open discussion of political issues and participation in civil society organizations, and the descriptive representation of women in formal political positions.

Aggregation: This index receives a maximum score of two resulting from the addition of the two terms easiness of initiation and easiness of approval of popular initiatives, where each term obtains a maximum value of one.
The ease of initiation is measured by:
• The existence of a direct democracy process v2ddlexci,
• The number of signatures needed v2ddsigpci, and
• Time-limits to circulate the signatures v2ddsigdci.
Easiness of approval is measured by the surface of the polygon determined by:
• Participation quorum v2ddpartci, • Approval quorum v2ddapprci, and
• Supermajority v2ddspmci.
For an elaboration of the interaction among quorums, see David Altman (2017). The resulting score is then multiplied with (d) district majority v2ddadmci.
Consequences are measured by:
• The legal status of the decision made by citizens binding or merely consultative v2ddlexci, and
• The frequency and degree of success with which direct popular votes have been held in the past v2ddthreci. The baseline for those countries that have the legal apparatus to hold a particular MDD but have never experienced one is 0.1.
The index is aggregated using this formula:
v2xdd_i_ci = [(IF v2ddlexci > 0,1,0) × (1 - v2ddsigpci))

5.11.1	Core civil society index (D) (v2xcs_ccsi)
Project Manager(s): Michael Bernhard
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd Question: How robust is civil society?
Clarification: The sphere of civil society lies in the public space between the private sphere and the state. Here, citizens organize in groups to pursue their collective interests and ideals. We call these groups civil society organizations CSOs. CSOs include, but are by no means limited to, interest groups, labor unions, spiritual organizations if they are engaged in civic or political activities, social movements, professional associations, charities, and other non-governmental organizations.
The core civil society index CCSI is designed to provide a measure of a robust civil society, understood as one that enjoys autonomy from the state and in which citizens freely and actively pursue their political and civic goals, however conceived.

5.12 Elections
5.12.1	Electoral regime index (A) (v2x_elecreg)
Project Manager(s): Staffan I. Lindberg, Jan Teorell
Question: At this time, are regularly scheduled national elections on course, as stipulated by election law or well-established precedent?
Clarification: Coded 0 until an executive or legislative election is held, defined by v2xel_elecpres and v2xel_elecparl, then set to 1 until any of the following two events occur (if they occur): (a) that the election was "aborted", meaning that those elected did not resume power, as defined by v2x_hosabort and v2x_legabort; or (b) an "electoral interruption", meaning that either the legislature was shut down, as defined by v2xlg_leginter, or there was an executive coup, as defined by v2x_hosinter; in the case of (a) or (b), v2x_elecreg is set to 0 until there is another election. The operational indicator of an "aborted" executive election (v2x_hosabort) is that v2expathhs did not turn 7 within 12 months after the election, for a legislative election (v2x_legabort) that v2lgbicam did not turn positive within 12 months after the election. An interruption of the electoral regime occurring through the HOS, e.g. a coup d'etat, is indicated by v2x_hosinter as a change in v2xel_elecpres, meaning v2expathhs turned from 7 to something else, with the exception of 6, approval by the legislature (in case the legislature remained in place). An interruption of the electoral regime occurring through the legislature is defined by v2xlg_leginter based on v2lgbicam turning 0. We note that the coding of v2x_elecreg does not merely follow mechanically from the scores on these other variables, as the coding of v2x_elecreg has also been cross-checked and validated by research assistants. An executive and a legislative electoral regime cannot be separated since they form an integral part, where an aborted legislature is interpreted as a signal that also the executive is not standing for election any longer, and vice versa.

Clarification: The electoral principle of democracy seeks to achieve responsiveness and accountability between leaders and citizens through the mechanism of competitive elections. This is presumed to be achieved when suffrage is extensive; political and civil society organizations can operate freely; elections are clean and not marred by fraud or systematic irregularities; and the chief executive of a country is selected directly or indirectly through elections.

Question: Are citizens able to openly discuss political issues in private homes and in public spaces?
Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which citizens are able to engage in private discussions, particularly on political issues, in private homes and public spaces restaurants, public transportation, sports events, work etc. without fear of harassment by other members of the polity or the public authorities. We are interested in restrictions by the government and its agents but also cultural restrictions or customary laws that are enforced by other members of the polity, sometimes in informal ways.

Question: Do citizens enjoy freedom of movement and residence?
Clarification: This indicator specifies the extent to which citizens are able to move freely, in daytime and nighttime, in public thoroughfares, across regions within a country, and to establish permanent residency where they wish. Note that restrictions in movement might be imposed by the state and/or by informal norms and practices. Such restrictions sometimes fall on rural residents, on specific social groups, or on dissidents.
Do not consider restrictions in movement that are placed on ordinary non-political criminals. Do not consider restrictions in movement that result from crime or unrest.

Clarification: Involuntary servitude occurs when an adult is unable to quit a job s/he desires to leave - not by reason of economic necessity but rather by reason of employer's coercion. This includes labor camps but not work or service which forms part of normal civic obligations such as conscription or employment in command economies.

5.12.14	Legislature directly elected (D) (v2xex_elecleg)
Project Manager(s): Jan Teorell
Question: To what extent is the legislature directly or indirectly elected?
Clarification: If the legislature is unicameral, v2xex_elecleg is measured as the proportion of legislators directly elected + half of the proportion that are indirectly elected. If the legislature is bicameral and the upper house is involved in the appointment of the chief executive, the same proportion of directly and half of the indirectly elected legislators is calculated for the upper house; the scores for the lower and upper houses are then averaged.
Note that a popular election is minimally defined and also includes sham elections with limited suffrage and no competition.
This index is useful primarily for aggregating higher-order indices and should not necessarily be interpreted as an important element of democracy in its own right. Since the variables coding the share of directly and indirectly elected legislators are not yet fully in sync for all country dates, a few observations now receive an index value larger than 1.

5.13.1	Party institutionalization index (D) (v2xps_party)
Project Manager(s): Allen Hicken
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh
Question: To what extent are political parties institutionalized?
Clarification: Party institutionalization refers to various attributes of the political parties in a country, e.g., level and depth of organization, links to civil society, cadres of party activists, party supporters within the electorate, coherence of party platforms and ideologies, party-line voting among representatives within the legislature. A high score on these attributes generally indicates a more institutionalized party system.
This index considers the attributes of all parties with an emphasis on larger parties, i.e., those that may be said to dominate and define the party system.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

5.14.1	Divided party control index (D) (v2x_divparctrl)
Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: Are the executive and legislature controlled by different political parties?
Clarification: This variable is a reordered version of the continuous measurement model estimates for indicator v2psnatpar: National party control. After reordering, the positive extreme signifies Divided party control. A Different parties or individuals unconnected to parties control the executive and the legislature or B Executive power is divided between a president/monarch and a prime minister, each of which belongs to different parties; or between a non-partisan monarch and a prime minister. The intermediate values signify Unified coalition control. A single multi-party coalition controls the executive and legislative branches of the national government. This is true almost by definition in a parliamentary system where a single coalition gathers together a majority of seats. And the negative extreme signifies "Unified party control. A single party controls the executive and legislative branches of the national government. This is true almost by definition in a parliamentary system where a single party has a majority of seats." Scale: Interval, from low to high.
Source(s): v2psnatpar v2psnatpar_ord
Notes: V-Dem originally intended to generate indices to measure concepts inspired by Arend Lijphart's two dimensions of consensus vs. majoritarian democracy. The project no longer plans to produce such indices. Instead, it offers the two indices, the Divided party control index and the Division of power index, which are conceptually thinner than Lijphart's concepts and not equivalent substitutes for them. However, these alternatives are useful for some purposes.
Data release: 6-13. For Version 6 as Divided party control of legislature index v2x_lgdivparctrl, 7 modified to Divided party control index.
Aggregation: The reordering is accomplished in two steps. First, 5 is subtracted from v2psnatpar when the ordinal version of this variable, v2psnatpar_ord, is 2. This moves the ordinal score corresponding to unified party control to the lowest values. Then the result is standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Project Manager(s): Michael Coppedge, Svend-Erik Skaaning
Question: Are there elected local and regional governments, and - if so - to what extent can they operate without interference from unelected bodies at the local level?
Clarification: The lowest score would be reserved for a country that has no elected local or regional governments, or where all or nearly all elected offices are subordinate to non-elected offices at any local or regional level that exists. A high score would be accorded to a country in which both local and regional governments are elected and able to operate without restrictions from unelected actors at the local or regional level with the exception of judicial bodies. A medium score can be achieved in various ways: there are strong elected governments at the

However, these alternatives are useful for some purposes. Data release: 6-13.
Aggregation: This index is an equally weighted average of a local government index and a regional government index. The local government index is the product of a dummy variable for the existence of local government (v2ellocgov), a recoded version of Local government elected (v2ellocelc), and a CDF of local offices relative power (v2ellocpwr). Local governments are recoded as unelected 0 if they did not exist or if data is missing. They are coded 0.5 if an executive is elected but no assembly, and 1 if an assembly is elected, with or without an executive. The regional government index is calculated the same way but using the existence of regional government (v2elreggov), regional government elected (v2elsrgel), and regional offices relative power (v2elrgpwr).

Project Manager(s): Katrin Kinzelbach, Ilyas Saliba, Janika Spannagel
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is academic freedom respected?
Clarification: Academic freedom is understood as the right of academics, without constriction by prescribed doctrine, to freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom in carrying out research and disseminating and publishing the results thereof, freedom to express freely their opinion about the institution or system in which they work, freedom from institutional censorship and freedom to participate in professional or representative academic bodies (UNESCO 1997 Recommendation concerning the Status of Higher-Education Teaching Personnel). The Academic Freedom Index is designed to provide an aggregated measure that captures the de facto realization of academic freedom, including the degree to which higher-education institutions are autonomous.

6 Digital Society Survey
The Digital Society Survey, designed by the Digital Society Project, contains questions pertaining to the political environment of the internet and social media. The data collected through expert-coded surveys provides information on topics related to coordinated information operations, digital media freedom, online media polarization, social cleavages as well as state internet regulation capacity and approach.
Principal investigators for the Digital Society Project are Valeriya Mechkova, Daniel Pemstein, Brigitte Seim, Steven Wilson.
For more information, please visit www.digitalsocietyproject.org.
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Digital society: The following survey contains questions pertaining to the political environment of the Internet and social media. Please bear in mind the following definitions as you respond to questions on this survey:
The government and its agents include official government organs, such as bureaucracies, courts, intelligence services, and the military, but also unofficial agents, such as officially unaffiliated cyber-warfare operatives who perform services, even "off-book" work, on behalf of the government.
Major political parties include the group of political parties that hold a significant number of seats in national legislative body(-ies), or earn a significant number of votes in elections for the executive. When we ask you to consider "major political parties," you do not need to consider parties that run in elections but receive only a small minority of seats or votes, or those that receive no seats at all.
We define the Internet as all information that people access over public and private digital networks, worldwide. The Internet includes both publicly accessible digital spaces and private or gated information transmission platforms. The Internet does not include traditional media transmission mechanisms such as paper, television, traditional voice telephone, and radio.
Social media are a subset of Internet platforms that enable normal individuals to create and share content with networks of other people. Social media platforms are available to the public, although content on such networks may be shared privately within subgroups of users. Social media includes both publicly visible, or semi-public platforms, like Facebook, Flickr, Friendster, Google+, Instagram, Myspace, LinkedIn, Twitter, VKontakte, and Weibo and private social networking and messaging platforms like Signal, Slack, Snapchat, or WhatsApp.
Domestic online media is any media source originating in the country in question. For example, the New York Times' website is domestic online media in the United States, but not in India, even though it operates bureaus in India. Media includes any source reporting on current events or political issues, ranging from well-established brands to newsletters and websites run by an individual.
Cyber security threats include penetration of private digital networks, using means ranging from exploiting software vulnerabilities, password cracking, or social engineering (e.g., tricking individuals into revealing passwords or other information necessary to break into a digital system) to obtain information or disrupt an organization or individual's use of digital networks and tools. They also include unauthorized alterations of an individual or organization's digital presence, such as defacing websites and commandeering social media accounts. These threats range from unsophisticated (e.g., exploitation of failure to password protect private networks or use of common passwords by authorized users, and spear phishing) to moderate (e.g., embedding malicious code in emails or exploiting well-known software flaws that organizations have failed to patch), to sophisticated (e.g., exploiting unknown exploits in commonly used software or even embedding exploits into commercial systems unbeknownst to their creators).
6.1 Coordinated Information Operations
Clarification: When we discuss shutting down online content, please consider instances where a website (or websites) have been taken entirely offline as well as instances where a website (or websites) have been slowed down or had access similarly intentionally inhibited, such that use of this website is challenging. In other words, both outright shutting down and more subtle measures that inhibit access should be considered when answering these questions.
Clarification: When we discuss "censorship" or "censoring" content online, we are not concerned with censorship of topics such as child pornography, highly classified information such as military or intelligence secrets, or defamatory speech, unless this sort of censorship is used as a pretext for censoring political information or opinions.

7 Varieties of Indoctrination
The Varieties of Indoctrination (V-Indoc) dataset is constructed based on an expert survey fielded in collaboration with V-Dem and led by the ERC-funded project "Democracy under Threat: How Education can Save it" (DEMED). The dataset contains indices and indicators that measure indoctrination efforts in education and the media across 160 countries from 1945 to 2021. The indices capture broad dimensions of indoctrination such as indoctrination potential and indoctrination content, while the indicators cover topics related to the curriculum, teachers, schools, and the media.
The principal investigators are Anja Neundorf, Eugenia Nazrullaeva, Ksenia Northmore-Ball, Katerina Tertytchnaya, and Wooseok Kim.
For more information, please visit https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/democracyresearch/.
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

We will ask you 27 questions mainly related to the education system of your country of expertise. For each question we will ask you to provide annual responses for the years between 1945 and 2021. We will also ask you to rate how certain you are about each answer.
We are interested in formal public or publicly-funded education: that is, schools that are controlled, managed and funded by the public sector (a relevant national / sub-national / local public authority), as well as schools that are partially funded or subsidized by the public sector but operated by a private body (for example, schools that charge tuition but also receive some public funds or subsidies). We are not interested in schools fully controlled, managed and funded by a private body (for example, a non-governmental organization, a religious body, a special interest group, a foundation, a business enterprise). This means, for example, that religious schools will be included in our definition only if they are operated by a public authority or publicly-funded or subsidized by the public sector.
Unless clearly stated, our questions relate to formal education at the primary and secondary level, not distinguishing between the two levels. If there are substantive differences between the primary and secondary education levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of students.
Some questions distinguish between primary and secondary education. In cases, where upper secondary education is specialized, please think about lower secondary education. In defining different education levels, we use the International Standard Classification of Education classification adopted by UNESCO: primary education (ISCED level 1); secondary education (lower secondary ISCED level 2 and upper secondary ISCED level 3); tertiary education (ISCED level 6 and higher, that is, bachelor's, master's, doctoral or equivalent levels). We also define: post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED level 4); non-university level tertiary education (ISCED level 5, short-cycle tertiary education).
We are interested in changes over time at the aggregate country level. Please make sure your answers reflect educational reforms or changes in teaching practices over time.
We intend for all questions to concern the majority or plurality of public or publicly funded schools, teachers and pupils in a given country and year. For each question, please try to think of what would be expected in the most typical school. In cases where sub-national differences exist due to decentralized education systems, please consider policies and practices in the most populous sub-national units.
Many of our questions pertain to the official curriculum. The official curriculum (set by national / sub-national / local authorities / school administrations) may include: textbooks, topics covered in subject syllabi, teaching materials, as well as the list of subjects that are to be taught by schools and the amount of time that should be devoted to each subject.
7.1 Indoctrination Indices
7.1.1	Indoctrination potential in education (D) (v2xed_ed_inpt)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: How strong is the potential for indoctrination in education?
Clarification: The potential of regimes to successfully indoctrinate through education is based on their control over the structures and processes of the education system. The index is a function of the coherence of the regime's doctrine (whether it be democratic or autocratic) and the effort devoted to political education. Greater coherence and political education efforts are expected to generate higher potential for indoctrination.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1). Source(s): v2xed_ed_poed v2xed_ed_inco Data release: 13.
Aggregation:	We	estimate	the	index	by	averaging	two	indices:	v2xed_ed_poed	and v2xed_ed_inco.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: Are political values and ideology emphasized in education?
Clarification: This index measures the extent to which the regime attempts to teach its core political values and ideologies through education based on political education in primary and secondary schools, and the teaching of a dominant ideology in the history curriculum.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1). Source(s): v2edpoledprim v2edpoledsec v2edideol Data release: 13.

7.1.3	Indoctrination coherence in education (D) (v2xed_ed_inco)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: How coherent are the means of indoctrination in education?
Clarification: This index measures the extent to which a coherent single doctrine of political values and model citizenship is known and promoted by educational agents. The index is a function of the centralization of the education system and the regime's control over educational agents. Greater centralization and control are expected to lead to a more coherent doctrine being taught through education.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1). Source(s): v2xed_ed_cent v2xed_ed_ctag Data release: 13.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: How strong is state-control over agents in education?
Clarification: This index measures the extent to which the regime is able to control teachers and teaching practices inside the classroom based on the strength of teacher autonomy and unions, and the hiring/firing of teachers.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

7.1.6	Indoctrination content in education (D) (v2xed_ed_con)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the indoctrination content in education democratic (and not patriotic)?
Clarification: This index combines indicators from the democratic and patriotic indoctrination content indices in education (i.e., v2xed_ed_dmcon and v2xed_ed_ptcon). This index should be used if patriotic principles are considered to be at odds with democratic principles, i.e., higher values of the patriotic content indicators will be associated with lower values of this index. If democratic and patriotic indoctrination content are considered to be orthogonal, v2xed_ed_dmcon and v2xed_ed_ptcon should be used instead.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the indoctrination content in education democratic?
Clarification: Indoctrination content in education can range from being democratic (participatory, critical, pluralist) to autocratic (loyal/obedient, uncritical, single view/ideology). This index measures the democratic/autocratic character of the regime's doctrine based on the core teaching principles and the level of contestation promoted in education.
Scale: Interval, from low to high (0-1).

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd
Question: To what extent is the indoctrination content in education patriotic?
Clarification: Patriotism is another key tool that regimes can use to build political support for the broader political community. This index measures the extent of patriotic content in education by focusing on patriotic content in the curriculum as well as the celebration of patriotic symbols in schools more generally.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent does a national authority set the official curriculum framework for schools?
Clarification: The official curriculum may only be a framework, to which individual schools can contribute.
For this question, we are interested in all school subjects across levels of primary and secondary public education. If there are substantive differences between the primary and secondary education levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of schools.
A national (or federal) authority can include a state body organized under the auspices of a Ministry of Education.
The sub-national level includes states, provinces, districts, municipalities, villages, local educational authorities, etc.
Responses:
0: A national authority does not set the official curriculum framework, that is, the curriculum framework is completely set by sub-national authorities.
1: Sub-national authorities mostly set the official curriculum framework, with some input from

the national authority.
2: A national authority mostly sets the official curriculum framework, with some input from sub-national authorities.
3: A national authority fully sets the official curriculum framework.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: What proportion of school textbooks across core subjects does a national authority approve centrally?
Clarification: For this question, we are interested in core subjects, such as languages, mathematics, science, arts, social studies, history, geography. We are not interested in textbooks teaching foreign languages that could be subcontracted to a foreign publisher.
Please consider school subjects across levels of formal primary and secondary public education. If there are substantive differences between the primary and secondary education levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of schools.
Examples of ways in which textbook production is centrally approved or authorized include: a national public authority reviews textbook content and approves textbooks for use in schools; there is a state-mandated national list of textbooks that schools are recommended to use; the Ministry of Education directly publishes textbooks. A national (or federal) authority can include a public authority organized under the auspices of a Ministry of Education or a different authority.
Responses:
0: No textbooks are centrally approved by a national authority.
1: Some textbooks are centrally approved by a national authority. 2: All textbooks are centrally approved by a national authority.

7.3.1	Political education, primary school (C) (v2edpoledprim)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Are primary school students required to study at least one subject that predominately

focuses on teaching political values?
Clarification: Examples of subjects that focus on teaching political values include specific subjects in political education, as well subjects where political values are integrated in the curriculum: for example, moral, religious, and civic education; ethics and civics; 'knowledge about society' with elements of sociology, politics, legal studies, or economics. This does not include history

as a subject. We are not interested in de jure subject labels but in de facto subject content: a course does not need to be entitled "political values" to be considered here.
Political values refer to goals that are the desirable purposes for socio-political organizations such as the political community, the nation-state, and regime. Political values guide an individual's or group's general behavior/attitudes toward political 'objects' (e.g. leaders, events, ideologies).
Responses:
0: No. There is no general requirement for the majority of primary school students to study at least one subject predominately focused on political values.
1: Yes. The majority of primary school students are required to study at least one subject that is predominately focused on political values.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent does the curriculum of subjects that include the teaching of political values cover topics related to individuals' political rights and duties?
Clarification: In this question we are asking about the subjects you considered in the previous two questions, on average across primary and secondary education. Again, these subjects may be specifically focused on political education or may be subjects into which the teaching of political values is only integrated.
	Political rights and duties include:	guarantees of equal political opportunities and equal

protection under the law, regardless of race, religion, gender, or other personal attributes; the right or duty to vote; the right to organize and protest; or the right to join labor unions.
Responses:
0: These subjects do not cover these topics.
1: These subjects rarely cover these topics.
2: These subjects cover these topics, but not at depth. 3: These subjects cover these topics in some depth.

7.3.4	Patriotic education in the curriculum (C) (v2edpatriot)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: How often does the language curriculum promote patriotism?

Clarification: We are interested in the curriculum for core subjects in language studies, common to a majority of students, for example, teaching the official language(s) of the country. We are not interested in foreign languages.
By promoting patriotism, we mean encouraging feelings of love, pride, loyalty and commitment to one's country. For example, promoting patriotism can take the form of teaching narratives that celebrate the country's military past, national origin stories, the majority ethnic or religious group, or accomplishments in economic or technological sectors. Patriotic education could be part of the texts used to teach basic literacy skills (e.g. handwriting exercises), language textbooks, assigned readings in the literature curriculum, as well as in accompanying teaching manuals.
	Please consider a typical situation for students in primary and secondary schools.	If the

situation varies across educational levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of students.
Responses:
0: Rarely or never.
1: Sometimes.
2: Often.
3: Extensively.

7.3.5	Ideology in the curriculum (C) (v2edideol)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: How often does the history curriculum promote a specific societal model or ideology?

Clarification: A societal model or ideology is generally a codified set of beliefs used to justify a particular social and political order, for example, socialism, democracy, liberalism, fascism or social orders related to a specific religion.
The history curriculum can promote a specific ideology or societal model by often referring to

it and clearly interpreting one model as better than other alternatives.
We are not just interested in de jure history subjects, but also in the de facto subject content. Please consider a typical situation for students in primary and secondary schools. If the

situation varies across educational levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of students.

Question: When historical events are taught, to what extent are students exposed to diverse views and/or interpretations of these events?
Clarification: We are not interested in de jure history subjects but in the de facto subject content, that is, in history-related subjects or in subjects that are predominantly focused on teaching history.
We are interested in how much space is given to alternative viewpoints, such as alternative political ideologies, in the teaching of history. For example, if the major international conflict is taught, it can be studied exclusively from the perspective of the country's now-dominant power.

Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: To what extent do students have opportunities to discuss what they are taught in history

classes?
Clarification: This question regards the degree to which students are de facto given the opportunity to engage in debates which question the material and content of their history classes, as well as being able to voice disagreement with each other. Critical engagement with the content can be expressed by engaging in discussions with the teacher or other students, in oral presentations, or in written work (for example, exams and essays).
Opportunity means that critically engaging with the content would not bring down students' marks.
Responses:
0: Students are never or rarely given the opportunity to discuss what they are taught.

1: Students are sometimes given the opportunity to discuss what they are taught.
2: Students are often given the opportunity to discuss what they are taught.
3: Students are extensively given the opportunity to discuss what they are taught.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Do history teachers have autonomy to deviate from the content of the official curriculum

in the classroom?
Clarification: Here we aim to capture the degree to which teachers have autonomy to de facto deviate from the intended or official curriculum in their classes. Examples of how teachers can deviate from the content of the official curriculum: selecting textbooks that are different from those authorized or recommended by a central authority; diverging from the official curriculum in terms of the amount of time allocated to different topics, or supplement/expand on the official curriculum.
In cases where there is no official history curriculum, or the official history curriculum sets only loose restrictions on teachers' autonomy, please code this question as zero (generally autonomous).
Responses:

0: They are free to deviate to a large extent: teachers are generally autonomous.
1: They are free to deviate to a moderate extent: teachers' autonomy is somewhat restricted.
2: They are free to deviate to a small extent: teachers' autonomy is mostly restricted. 3: They are not at all free to deviate: teachers' autonomy is completely restricted.

Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: What are the de facto education requirements to become a primary school teacher?

Clarification: If there is substantive variation at the sub-national or local levels, please consider the education requirements for the majority of primary school teachers in the country. Some countries may require a degree/diploma in education and others may accept a degree in any subject - indicate the completed education level required regardless of specialization. Please consider initial requirements to be a teacher not those for further professional development.
Responses:
0: There are no educational requirements for aspiring teachers beyond proof of basic literacy and/or numeracy skills (ISCED Level 2 or lower).
1: Aspiring teachers must have completed a secondary school level education (ISCED Level 3). 2: Aspiring teachers must have achieved an education at the post-secondary, non-university level (for example, technical or vocational institutions) (ISCED Level 4).
3: Aspiring teachers must have completed at least one degree program taught at the university level (ISCED Level 5 and above).
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.

7.4.2	Teacher inspection (C) (v2temonitor)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Is there a comprehensive monitoring system in place for public authorities to conduct external teacher inspection?
Clarification: This question concerns the formal monitoring efforts of the relevant public/government authorities (national / sub-national / local authorities / school district administration) to conduct external inspection of teachers, that is, it concerns the operations of a formal bureaucratic hierarchy outside of school that works to inspect teachers. We are not interested in peer review observations of teachers working in the same school. We are not interested in de jure formal procedures but whether they are de facto carried out in practice. Teacher inspection can include external inspectors conducting teaching observations inside the classroom or during a class, before a class (audits of teachers' lesson plans) or after a class (for example, audits of students' notebooks and teachers' assessment of students' schoolwork). We define a comprehensive inspection in the following way(s): inspections are regular, conducted according to standardized and transparent protocols, with impartial and objective judgements; inspection results are reported to relevant national or sub-national government offices, etc.
If there are substantive differences between the primary and secondary education levels, please provide the response that is most accurate for the majority of schools.
Responses:
0: There is no external teacher inspection.
1: While there is a system in place for external teacher inspection, it is not comprehensive.

2: There is a generally comprehensive system in place for external teacher inspection.

Clarification: Please answer this question without taking into account the nature of the union. That is, for the purposes of this question it is irrelevant if the teacher union is distinct or part of a larger union (e.g. a trade union federation). This question does not concern why
a teacher's union does or does not exist. It is irrelevant if a union does not exist because (teacher) unionization is formally prohibited, teacher unionization can be allowed de jure but prohibited de facto due to government pressure, or there can be a lack of organization capacity among teachers.
Responses:
0: No officially recognized teacher unions exist. 1: Officially recognized teacher unions exist.

Question: Are officially recognized teacher unions independent from political authorities?
Clarification: Please answer this question regardless of the nature of teacher unions, that is, it is irrelevant if teacher unions are distinct or part of a comprehensive union (e.g. trade union federations). In cases where there is substantive sub-national variation, please consider teacher unions in the most populous sub-national units.
Political authorities can be national / sub-national / local public authorities and include ruling political parties and office holders such as presidents, prime minister or ministers.
This question does not distinguish between different mechanisms that can lead to teacher unions being dependent on the state. It is irrelevant if the relationship with the state was due to coercion, co-optation, or voluntary strategic alliances.

Question: To what extent are hiring decisions for teachers based on their political views and/or political behavior and/or moral character?
Clarification: Please consider hiring decisions across all subjects.
This question concerns actual practice (de facto, not legislation pertaining to the recruitment procedures for teachers).
This question concerns hiring decisions based on political views, or statements, participation in political protests, or membership in political parties or other organizations on the part of hiring candidates. Note that these behaviors can result in either a) relevant candidates not being hired (for example, being denied a teaching job due to a party affiliation) and b) only specific candidates being hired (for example, being hired due to pro-regime ideological affinities, party membership or moral character). Note that sometimes "moral character" is used as a pretext for political hiring decisions. In such cases, treat this pretext as political.
Please consider the situation for both primary and secondary school teachers. If there are substantive differences between the primary and secondary education levels, please provide the response that applies to the majority of teachers.

Clarification: This question pertains to firings of teachers on the basis of their political views, statements or membership in parties or organizations. We are not interested in firings for reasons related to their performance or professional competencies.
	Dominant political order:	A country's political norms and key political institutions and

authorities. We are not interested in the violations of predominant social, cultural and moral norms unless they are explicitly politicized.
Public expression of political views can happen at school or outside of school (for example, public tweets, participation in a protest).

Clarification: If there are fewer than four national print media, please provide your answer based on the number of existing national print media.
By print media, we refer to newspapers, magazines, or printed journals whose content can be consumed through their printed or online editions. In this question, we are only interested in state ownership of the media - not in the extent to which the state may control editorial decisions.
	State ownership takes different forms.	For example, state-owned media can be funded by

government license fees and advertising. They can also be directly controlled by government agencies (e.g. the Ministry of Information and Culture). The state, the ruling party, or the Head of Government / the Head of State, can also be the owner of media in this context.
Responses:
0: There are no state-owned print media outlets.
1: State-owned outlets make up a minority of print media outlets.
2: There is an equal share of state- and non-state owned print media outlets.

3: State-owned outlets make up the majority of print media outlets. 4: All print media outlets are state-owned.

7.6.2	State-owned broadcast media (C) (v2medstatebroad)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Out of the top four national broadcast media with the largest audience, how many are state-owned?
Clarification: If there are fewer than four national broadcast media, please provide your answer based on the number of existing national broadcast media.
Broadcast media includes radio and television stations whose content can be consumed offline or online, for example, through station's websites. Here, we are only interested in state ownership of the media - not in the extent to which the state may control editorial decisions.
	State ownership takes different forms.	For example, state-owned media can be funded by

government license fees and advertising. They can also be directly controlled by government agencies (e.g. the Ministry of Information and Culture). The state, the ruling party, or the Head of Government / the Head of State, can also be the owner of media in this context.
Responses:
0: There are no state-owned broadcast media outlets.
1: State-owned outlets make up a minority of media broadcast outlets.
2: There is an equal share of state- and non-state owned broadcast media outlets.

3: State-owned outlets make up the majority of broadcast media outlets. 4: All broadcast media outlets are state-owned.
Ordering: If v2medstateprint and v2medstatebroad are both set to 0 do not answer v2medpolstate. If both are set to 4 do not answer v2medpolnonstate.
Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.
Notes: This is a filtering question for v2medpolstate and v2medpolnonstate.

7.6.3	Political influence, state-owned media (C) (v2medpolstate)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: For the print and broadcast media outlets owned by the state, how often do political

authorities influence how these outlets cover political issues?
Clarification: Political authorities can be national / sub-national / local public authorities and include ruling political parties and office holders, such as presidents, prime minister or ministers. Political authorities can influence which political issues state-media cover, how, and how much they cover them. For example, they can exert influence by directly or indirectly controlling the hiring and firing of producers, directors, writers, editors, and announcers; by manipulating the resources these media require; by withholding resources required for printing or broadcast. Political authorities can also directly dictate content and make editorial decisions.
Responses:
0: Political authorities (almost) never influence the coverage of political issues.

1: Political authorities sometimes influence the coverage of political issues.
2: Political authorities often influence the coverage of political issues.
3: Political authorities almost always influence the coverage of political issues.

Scale: Ordinal, converted to interval by the measurement model.

7.6.4	Political influence, non state-owned media (C) (v2medpolnonstate)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: For the print and broadcast media outlets NOT owned by the state, how often do

political authorities influence how these cover political issues?
Clarification: Political authorities can be national / sub-national / local public authorities and include ruling political parties and office holders, such as presidents, prime minister or ministers. Political authorities can influence the coverage of non-state owned outlets both directly and indirectly. Indirect forms of control might include politically motivated awarding of broadcast frequencies, withdrawal of financial support, influence over printing facilities (e.g. subsidized newsprint) and distribution networks, selected distribution of advertising, onerous registration requirements, and prohibitive tariffs. They might also include tax privileges, bribery, and cash payments. Indirect forms of control may also include the intimidation of owners, advertisers, and editors, through the use of threats and violence.
Responses:
0: Political authorities (almost) never influence the coverage of key political issues.

1: Political authorities sometimes influence the coverage of key political issues.
2: Political authorities often influence the coverage of key political issues.
3: Political authorities almost always influence the coverage of key political issues.

7.6.5	Patriotism in the media (C) (v2medpatriot)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr Question: How often do media outlets promote patriotism?
Clarification: Promotion of patriotism can be associated with promotion of patriotic consciousness, the love of the country, national pride, loyalty and commitment. For example, specific narratives can celebrate the country's military past, national origin stories, or accomplishments in economic or technological sectors. Patriotism can be promoted in news, movies, TV shows, radio shows, music, or magazines.
For this question, please consider all (state-owned as well as not state-owned) broadcast and print media outlets.
Responses:
0: Rarely or never.
1: Sometimes.
2: Often.
3: Extensively.

7.6.6	Control of entertainment content (C) (v2medentrain)
Project Manager(s): Anja Neundorf
Additional versions: *_osp, *_ord, *_codelow, *_codehigh, *_sd, *_mean, *_nr
Question: Do political authorities have control over the production of entertainment content?
Clarification: Entertainment includes both broadcast and print content, such as movies, TV shows, radio shows, music, and magazines.
Here we distinguish between entertainment content and news content (although, in some cases news content can have an entertainment component, and vice versa), focusing on entertainment. Political authorities can be national / sub-national / local public authorities and include ruling political parties and office holders, such as presidents, prime minister or ministers. It is irrelevant how political authorities came to exert the control over the entertainment content.
Responses:
0: Political authorities exert almost no control over the production of entertainment content.
1: Political authorities exert some control over the production of entertainment content. 2: Political authorities exert a high level of control over the production of entertainment content.
3: Political authorities almost exclusively control the production of entertainment content.

8.4 World Bank Governance Indicators
8.4.1	Control of corruption - estimate (E) (e_wbgi_cce)
Clarification: "Control of Corruption" measures perceptions of corruption, conventionally defined as the exercise of public power for private gain. The particular aspect of corruption measured by the various sources differs somewhat, ranging from the frequency of "additional payments to get things done", to the effects of corruption on the business environment, to measuring "grand corruption" in the political arena or in the tendency of elite forms to engage in "state capture".

8.7 Political Institutions and Political Events
8.7.1	Coups (E) (e_coups)
Clarification: Number of successful coups d'état during a given year. A coup is any event resulting in an irregular removal or resignation of the chief executive that involves a violent action or an explicit threat of resorting to it, by an armed organization. Assassinations of the chief executive are not considered coups unless the group responsible for the action takes over the office. Whenever the rules about the replacement of the chief executive are either not codified or unclear, the force criterion prevails. The definition excludes resignations under pressure of popular mobilization if no armed group (legal or not) is involved (resignation of Carlos Mesa in Bolivia). Similarly, irregular transfers of power among civilians that do not entail force (such as changes of communist leaders) are not considered coups. We place no restriction on whether the armed group causing the replacement is domestic or foreign, nor on the identity of the incoming ruler. In particular, any military intervention of foreign powers producing a replacement of the chief executive is coded as a coup, even if they restore a previously elected ruler (French troops overthrowing Bokassa in Central African Republic). As a general rule, any replacement of a military chief executive by another military man is considered a coup, unless the succession occurred according to pre-established rules (Figueirido replacing Geisel in Brazil). Specifically, resignations of the military chief executive caused by votes of non-confidence of irregular military bodies are considered coups (Galtieri replacing Viola in Argentina). The variable is compatible to other conventional sources such as Powell and Thyne (2011), Marshall and Marshall (2009), and Svolik and Akcinaroglu (2010) for the period 1950. 2008, with some difference in the interpretation of specific events. Information for the pre-1950 era is more scarce and therefore the coding may be less reliable.
Source(s): Przeworski et al. (2013).
Notes: Where there is more than one observation per country-year, the maximum of the variable for this period is taken.
Data release: 5-13.
Citation: Przeworski et al. (2013). Years: 1789-2008
8.7.2	Number of Parties in legislature (E) (e_legparty)
Clarification: Number of parties in the legislature. By "party" we take here any recognizable, named grouping, regardless whether and how they appeared in elections. This variable is coded regardless whether the legislature was elected or appointed.
Responses:
-1: if no legislature.
0: if none (including cases where parties are officially banned).
8.8 Polity 5
1: if one (including cases where other parties are officially banned). 2: if more.
Scale: Nominal.
Source(s): Przeworski et al. (2013).
Notes: During the early period candidates typically competed in elections on an individual basis, without any kind of centralized party organizations or shared programs. Within legislatures, however, they often coalesced into groups, currents, factions, "sentiments," etc. Hence, subjective judgments are inevitable in coding this variable. Our rule of thumb was to code as parties any kind of groups that bare a label that survived over two consecutive legislatures. This was true in several countries of "Liberals" and "Conservatives." In other countries, notably France between 1815 and 1848, however, the divisive issues, the parliamentary groups, and their labels changed frequently, and such cases are coded as "none." A legislature consisting of one party and independents is coded as one party. When there is more than one observation per country-year, the one which has higher value is taken.

8.8 Polity 5
8.8.1	Institutionalized autocracy (E) (e_autoc)
Question: Is the polity an institutionalized autocracy?
Clarification: Autocracy is defined operationally in terms of the presence of a distinctive set of political characteristics. In mature form, autocracies sharply restrict or suppress competitive political participation. Their chief executives are chosen in a regularized process of selection within the political elite, and once in office they exercise power with few institutional constraints.
Responses:
Numeric.

Data release: 5-13.
Citation: Polity 5 (Marshall and Jaggers 2020). Years: 1789-2020
8.8.2	Institutionalized democracy (E) (e_democ)
Question: Is the polity an institutionalized democracy?
Clarification: Democracy is conceived as three essential, interdependent elements. One is the presence of institutions and procedures through which citizens can express effective preferences about alternative policies and leaders. Second is the existence of institutionalized constraints on the exercise of power by the executive. Third is the guarantee of civil liberties to all citizens in their daily lives and in acts of political participation.
The Democracy indicator is an additive eleven-point scale (0-10). The operational indicator of democracy is derived from codings of the competitiveness of political participation (PARCOMP), the openness and competitiveness of executive recruitment (XROPEN and XRCOMP), and constraints on the chief executive (XCONST).

8.8.3	Polity combined score (E) (e_p_polity)
Question: What is the Polity score?
Clarification: The Polity score is computed by subtracting the autocracy score from the democracy score. The resulting unified POLITY scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10
(strongly autocratic).

8.8.4	Political competition (E) (e_polcomp)
Question: Is there any (institutionalized) political competition?
Clarification: This variable combines information presented in two component variables: the degree of institutionalization, or regulation, of political competition (e_parreg) and the extent of government restriction on political competition (e_parcomp).
Responses:
1: Repressed Competition: While no significant political activity is permitted outside the ranks of the hegemonic regime, nevertheless, some organized political participation occurs within the regime through highly circumscribed institutional channels.
2: Restricted Competition: Some organized political activity occurs outside the ranks of the hegemonic regime, but the regime systematically limits its form, extent, or both in ways that exclude substantial groups from participating in the political arena and/or suppresses the contestation of rival political interests.
3: Authoritarian-guided liberalization of repressed or restricted competition or the deepening of hegemonic control: Used to indicate either the concerted effort on the part of hegemonic regimes to open up their political systems to limited (and typically factional) political competition or the transformation of factional-based "quasi-democracies" or "weak authoritarian regimes" into more repressive hegemonic systems in which political competition is increasingly institutionalized and restricted.
4: Uninstitutionalized Competition: Political participation is decentralized and fluid in character - revolving around personalities, regional interests, and religious/ethnic/clan groups. There are no enduring national political organizations and systematic regime control of political activity is limited, that is, a situation characterized by a coincidence of weak state and weak society. In the contemporary context, uninstitutionalized competition is most likely to occur in resource poor countries and/or following the collapse of central authority under a (former) repressive, authoritarian state.
5: Gradual transition from uninstitutionalized (unregulated) competition to more regulated forms of political competition (the increasing regulation of competition may be centrally-guided or decentralized through the gradual development of political parties and interest groups).
6: Factional/Restricted Competition: Polities that oscillate more or less regularly between intense factionalism and faction-based restrictions: that is, when one faction secures power it uses that power to promote its exclusive interests and favor group members while restricting the political access and activities of other, excluded groups, until it is displaced in turn.

7: Factional Competition: There are relatively stable and enduring political groups which compete for political influence at the national level - parties, regional groups, or ethnic groups - but particularistic/parochial agendas tend to be exclusive and uncompromising with limited social integration or accommodation across identity boundaries. Factional competition is distinguished by a relative balance of group capabilities that prevents any one of the groups from capturing state power and imposing restrictions on other groups.
8: Political liberalization or democratic retrenchment: persistent over coercion: relatively coercive/restrictive transitions either from factional/restricted competition to institutionalized competitive participation or from institutionalized competitive participation to factional/restricted competition. In either case, this code reflects the unconsolidated nature of liberal political participation in otherwise procedurally democratic polities.
9: Political liberalization or democratic retrenchment: limited and/or decreasing overt coercion: This code is used to indicate relatively peaceful transitions either to or from institutionalized competitive participation. In either case, this code reflects the unconsolidated nature of liberal political participation in otherwise procedurally open electoral polities.
10: Institutionalized open electoral participation: Relatively stable and enduring political groups regularly compete for political influence with little use of coercion. No significant or substantial groups, issues, or types of conventional political action are regularly excluded from the political process.

8.8.5	Polity revised combined score (E) (e_polity2)
Question: What is the Revised Polity score?
Clarification: This variable is a modified version of the Polity variable added in order to facilitate the use of the Polity regime measure in time-series analyses. It modifies the combined annual Polity score by applying a simple treatment to convert instances of standardized authority scores (i.e., -66, -77, and -88) to conventional polity scores (i.e., within the range, -10 to +10).
The values have been converted according to the following rule set:
-66: Cases of foreign interruption are treated as system missing.
-77: Cases of interregnum, or anarchy, are converted to a neutral Polity score of 0.
-88: Cases of transition are prorated across the span of the transition.
For example, country X has a POLITY score of -7 in 1957, followed by three years of -88 and, finally, a score of +5 in 1961. The change (+12) would be prorated over the intervening three years at a rate of per year, so that the converted scores would be as follows: 1957 -7; 1958 -4; 1959 -1; 1960 +2; and 1961 +5.

8.9 Others
8.9.1	Democratic breakdown (E) (e_bnr_dem)
Clarification: Countries that meet the minimum conditions for democracy (see below) enter the dataset and are coded "0." When countries cease to meet those minimum criteria they are coded "1" and exit from the dataset.
Scale: Dichotomous.
Source(s): Bernhard et al. (2001). Taken from Quality of Government Standard Dataset version Jan22 et al. (2022).
Notes: If, after a democratic breakdown, a country again meets our minimum criteria it re-enters the data as a new democratic episode. The time frame onset in 1913 is a function of when the first country (Norway) meets the minimum conditions. All series terminate in either in a breakdown in various years or right censorship in 2005. The minimal conditions are based on Dahl's notion of polyarchy (competitiveness, inclusiveness) combined with Linz and Stepan's stateness criteria. Competitiveness: Like Przeworski et al. we include countries that hold elections for both the executive and legislature, and in which more than one party contests the elections. However, we exclude cases in which we detected outcome changing vote fraud, in which there was either extensive or extreme violence that inhibited voters' preference expression, or in which political parties representing a substantial portion of the population were banned. Inclusiveness: We only include competitive polities in which at least fifty percent of all adult citizens are enfranchised to vote in our set of democracies. Stateness: We also considered questions of sovereignty, not including colonial states, where founding elections were held prior to the granting of independence, and countries experiencing internal wars in which twenty percent or greater of the population or territory was out of control of the state.

8.9.2	Democracy (E) (e_chga_demo)
Clarification: A regime is considered a democracy if the executive and the legislature is directly or indirectly elected by popular vote, multiple parties are allowed, there is de facto existence of multiple parties outside of regime front, there are multiple parties within the legislature, and there has been no consolidation of incumbent advantage (e.g. unconstitutional closing of the lower house or extension of incumbent's term by postponing of subsequent elections).
Transition years are coded as the regime that emerges in that year.

8.9.3	Corruption perception index (E) (e_ti_cpi)
Clarification: The CPI focuses on corruption in the public sector and defines corruption as the abuse of public office for private gain. The surveys used in compiling the CPI tend to ask questions in line with the misuse of public power for private benefit, with a focus, for example, on bribe-taking by public officials in public procurement. The sources do not distinguish between administrative and political corruption. The CPI Score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people, risk analysts and the general public and ranges between 100 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt).

12 Appendix B: Glossary
Attributes: This section includes the most specific conceptual building blocks we use to discuss democracy and related concepts. Many of our survey questions attempt to ask about a single attribute, for example, "What percentage of the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature is directly elected in popular elections?" Although any of these questions could also be seen as a compendium of multiple attributes (What does it mean to be a legislature? What is a "popular" election?), in a project covering all countries for more than a century, there are degrees of specificity that it is not practical to approach, so attributes are the most specific concepts that we consider feasible to measure.
Chief Executive: The Head of State or the Head of Government, depending on the relative power of each office.
Civil Society:	An organizational layer of the polity that lies between the state and private life.
Civil society is composed of voluntary associations of people joined together in common purpose. Four varieties of organizations should not be considered part of civil society:
• A: Any organization that has forced membership for some class of people (e.g. transmission belt organizations under totalitarian, post-totalitarian regimes, or authoritarian regimes).
• B: Economic firms (whether private or public). However, if owners or workers of firms organize for their mutual interest such organizations are part of civil society. Illustration-General Motors is not part of civil society, but any producers association it takes part in, or any labor union which its workers belong to, clearly is.
• C: Those parts of religious organizations devoted to the practice of spirituality. However, organizations devoted to social or political ends that are based in common religious belief or affiliation (the Moral Majority, CARE, American Friends Service Committee, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Anti-Defamation League, or the Council on American-Islamic Relations) are clearly part of civil society. To clarify: the Catholic Church should not be considered a civil society organization, but in many societies there are a multitude of Catholic organizations, linked to the Church in varying degrees, that are a part of civil society. Such public activities even when physically housed in places of worship should be considered civil society organizations (e.g., charitable or social action committees that are physically located on ecclesiastical property).
• D: Criminal Associations. Such associations may influence or even capture elements within the state or political society. They are not to be considered part of civil society. Examples include narcotics cartels, smuggling organizations, and slavery networks. Civic associations that are declared criminal by political authorities for carrying out civic or political activities should not be conflated with criminal associations.
Component and Subcomponent: Relative concepts that are useful when describing the structure of either a concept or an index. For example, egalitarianism is a component of egalitarian democracy, but egalitarianism in turn has its own components, including health and educational equality, which are therefore subcomponents of egalitarian democracy. The V-Dem conceptual scheme sometimes distinguishes five or more levels of specificity. Because these terms are relative, knowing whether a concept is a component or a subcomponent does not reveal how general or specific it is in an absolute sense.
Conceptions: The most general concepts of democracy. These are more complex notions that allow for a version of democracy to embrace multiple properties and dimensions. They are attempts to define more holistic, thick concepts that approach natural-language understandings of democracy. In doing so, they tend to overlap with other general concepts of democracy. For example, our conceptions of liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian democracy all include electoral democracy and therefore overlap quite a bit.

Country: A sovereign state or semi-sovereign territory. All political units of concern to V-Dem are referred to as countries, even though their status in international law varies-some being colonies others being nation-states or empires.
Cyber Security Threats: Cyber security threats include penetration of private digital networks, using means ranging from exploiting software vulnerabilities, password cracking, or social engineering (e.g., tricking individuals into revealing passwords or other information necessary to break into a digital system) to obtain information or disrupt an organization or individual's use of digital networks and tools. They also include unauthorized alterations of an individual or organization's digital presence, such as defacing websites and commandeering social media accounts. These threats range from unsophisticated (e.g., exploitation of failure to password protect private networks or use of common passwords by authorized users, and spear phishing) to moderate (e.g., embedding malicious code in emails or exploiting well-known software flaws that organizations have failed to patch), to sophisticated (e.g., exploiting unknown exploits in commonly used software or even embedding exploits into commercial systems unbeknownst to their creators).
Dimension: A property with an added empirical characteristic: it describes a straight line connecting two poles of a concept. It is practically synonymous with scale. Often we reserve the term dimension for properties whose attributes also can be arrayed between the same two poles. For example, if "civil liberty" is a dimension, many specific civil liberties are correlated: if a case has a high degree of freedom of discussion, it tends to have high degrees of freedom of movement, freedom to organize, freedom from political murder, and so on. There are exceptions, however, when there are accepted ways of reducing multidimensional attributes to a single dimension. For example, male suffrage and female suffrage vary somewhat independently but they can be combining into a dimension of adult suffrage.
Disadvantage: Refers to socioeconomic disadvantage. Specifically, a group or individual is judged disadvantaged if their annual income is significantly below the median national income.
Domestic Online Media: Domestic online media is any media source originating in the country in question. For example, the New York Times' website is domestic online media in the United States, but not in India, even though it operates bureaus in India. Media includes any source reporting on current events or political issues, ranging from well-established brands to newsletters and websites run by an individual.
Exclusion: Exclusion is when individuals are denied access to services or participation in governed spaces based on their identity or belonging to a particular group. It is not necessary for all members of a group to be excluded in order for group-based exclusion to occur. Exclusion occurs even when only a single individual is excluded based on her or his identity or membership (perceived or actual) in a particular group.
Geographic Group: Geographic group refers to those living in rural or urban areas. Urban areas are defined as an area that meets the following conditions: population density exceeds a threshold of 150 persons per square kilometer, there is access to a sizeable settlement of 50,000 people or more within some reasonable travel time, for example 60 minutes by road. (World Development Report, 2009: 54).
Government: The executive branch of the government, including its head of state (HOS) and/or head of government (HOG)-whichever is most prominent, or both if they are both powerful- along with the cabinet, ministries, and top civil servants. We are only concerned here with the government that actually resides within the country or semi-sovereign territory. Thus, in a typical British colony the government would include the governor-general and his local administration but not the King/Queen of England or the government of England.
Government and its Agents: The government and its agents include official government organs, such as bureaucracies, courts, intelligence services, and the military, but also unofficial agents, such as officially unaffiliated cyber-warfare operatives who perform services, even "off-book" work, on behalf of the government.
Head of Government (HOG): A head of government (HOG) is the chief officer(s) of the executive branch of its government, typically presiding over a cabinet. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer the questions respect to the head of government that is seated within the territory in question (such as the local prime minister in a British colony, not the prime minister in London).
Head of State (HOS): A head of state (HOS) is an individual or collective body that serves as the chief public representative of the country. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer the questions with respect to the head of state that is seated within the territory in question (such as the governor-general in a British colony, not the King/Queen of England).
High Court: By high court we mean the constitutional court of your country or the highest ordinary court. Specifically, if your country has a constitutional court, please answer the question with respect to that court. If there is no constitutional court, please answer the question with respect to the country's highest ordinary court. For example, in Mexico in 2004, you would consider the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and not the Electoral Tribunal for the Federal Judiciary. In Russia the same year, you would consider the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and not the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, and in Sweden, you would ignore the Supreme Administrative Court and instead focus on the Supreme Court. Germany has both a constitutional court, the Federal Constitutional Court, and a court of last resort for ordinary matters, the Federal Court of Justice. The Federal Constitutional Court is the high court for our purposes. In the United States, there is no separate constitutional court, tribunal, or review body. The Supreme Court of the United States is both the highest ordinary court and the highest court in the state with constitutional jurisdiction. Therefore we consider it to be the high court of the United States.
Sometimes a country's highest judicial body has separate chambers or divisions. If the court's judges do not rotate between divisions, and only one division possesses jurisdiction over constitutional matters, then please only consider that division in your responses. For example, the Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica has four chambers. The Fourth Chamber reviews constitutional matters, its judges are appointed to it specifically and the other judges of the Supreme Court do not rotate onto the Fourth Chamber. Therefore, the high court for Costa Rica is the constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice.
If the state is a federation, please focus on the federal judiciary. Finally, if you are considering a semisovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer this question with respect to highest ordinary court seated within the territory in question, not abroad (i.e., do not consider a colonial court like the Privy Council for British Colonies).
Index (Plural: indices):	A measure constructed from multiple variables or indicators.
Internet: We define the Internet as all information that people access over public and private digital networks, worldwide. The Internet includes both publicly accessible digital spaces and private or gated information transmission platforms. The Internet does not include traditional media transmission mechanisms such as paper, television, traditional voice telephone, and radio.
Legislature: A collective body, commonly associated with national governments, having the formal right to propose, amend, enact, and repeal legislation that is binding for the entire political unit. It is typically distinct from other branches of government such as the judiciary and the executive. Advisory bodies that do not have the formal authority to legislate-as stipulated by statute, legislative rules, the constitution, or common law precedent-are not considered legislatures. Legislative bodies typically have the power to decide on one or more of the following:
• National budget
• Domestic taxation
• International treaty ratification
• Instituting states of emergency
• Declaring war
• Territorial integrity and national sovereignty
• Executive oversight
Membership of a legislative body may be the result of a popular election, selection by lower level bodies, or appointment by representatives of the executive. A legislature may be organized as one or more chambers, often though not always, having distinct responsibilities.
A legislature is a permanent body, considered to exist from the day it has first convened until the end of its legal mandate; or until another date when the body is dissolved for another reason or when it is practically incapacitated during protracted states of emergency, civil wars, or similar conditions; or when its legal existence is eliminated by a suspension of the constitutional order.
Local Government: The lowest level of government recognized by the V-Dem project. Situated below regional government (if there is a regional government). Refers to government at the level of towns, cities, and counties/communes (all-inclusive).
Lower Chamber: The lower chamber in a bicameral legislature, sometimes also called the "second chamber," typically means the more numerous chamber that is also more directly representative of the general population. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please answer these questions with respect to the lower (or unicameral) chamber of the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the lower chamber of a local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the House of Commons in London).
Major Political Parties: Major political parties include the group of political parties that hold a significant number of seats in national legislative body(-ies), or earn a significant number of votes in elections for the executive. When we ask you to consider "major political parties", you do not need to consider parties that run in elections but receive only a small minority of seats or votes, or those that receive no seats at all.
National Government: The highest level of aggregation recognized by the V-Dem project. Refers to the national government of a sovereign state or the territorial level of government for a semisovereign colony or territory. Thus, the "national" government of India prior to independence-the British Raj-was situated in New Delhi, not in London-even though decisions affecting the Indian colony were often made in London.
Ordinary Court: A court with general jurisdiction or a court with civil and/or criminal jurisdiction.
Political Groups: Political groups are defined as those who are affiliated with a particular political party or candidate, or a group of parties/candidates. A common form of partisan exclusion is when state services or regulations are implemented in a way that seeks to reward incumbent political supporters and punish non-supporters.
Political Party: An organization that nominates candidates for public office. The term includes a longstanding coalition such as the CDU/CSU in Germany if that coalition functions in most respects like a single party. Sometimes, the identity of a party is obscured by name changes. However, if the party changes names but retains key personnel and is still run by and for the same constituencies then it should be considered the same organization.
Popular Election: A process of direct leadership selection in which voters choose parties or individuals to serve in executive offices or as representatives in legislative or constitutional assemblies. The only accepted mediation is the situation where voters select a body of electors, who are pledged to support specific candidates, and whose sole purpose is to intermediate the leadership selection process, as in US presidential elections.
The electorate (those allowed to vote) in a popular election may include all adult citizens or it may be restricted to particular groups (e.g., men, property holders, racial or ethnic groups). The extent of suffrage is not what qualifies an election as popular (so long as the number of voters is much larger than the number of representatives being selected). Likewise, the freeness or fairness of an election is not at issue. A popular election may be restricted to a single party or candidate, for example, but does not include referendums on term extensions for incumbents.
Principles: Properties with normative connotations. When we wish to make reference to the various intellectual traditions that have fostered debate about what democracy should be, we prefer the term principles to properties. For example, when describing theories of deliberative democracy, it is necessary to refer to philosophers such as Habermas who argue for the principle that governments must earn their authority to rule by respectfully providing citizens with rationales for their decisions- a normative claim. However, by referring to various principles we are not endorsing them, only saying that others do. Principles are not necessarily dimensions, as realizing a principle can require achieving a high standard on more than one dimension; and dimensions are not necessarily principles; but both are special types of properties.
Properties: Concepts that are more general than attributes. We speak of the participatory property of participatory democracy, for example, to call attention to the participatory aspects of participatory democracy, as distinct from the other features that it may share with egalitarian, liberal, electoral, or deliberative democracy. Because they are at a relatively high level of generality, properties tend to contain many attributes.
Public Authorities: Includes the government as well as subnational governments, agencies, parastatals, and the like. Compare State.
Regional Government: The second-highest level of government recognized by the V-Dem project. A regional government is situated below the national government. Regional units may be referred to as cantons, departments, provinces, regions, or states. Note that some countries are so small that they do not have regional governments, or did not have regional governments for some portion of the 20th century.
Semisovereign Territory: This refers to a country that is not fully sovereign but nonetheless exercises some-at least minimal-level of self-determination. Many of the countries of concern to this project began as colonies of an empire. If a country moved from semi-sovereign status to sovereign status over the course of the twentieth century-maintaining comparable borders-then we want to code both entities. Likewise, we want to include countries like Taiwan that are not universally recognized as sovereign but nonetheless enjoy self-determination (in part or in full).
Most questions pertaining to semi-sovereign territories ask you to reflect on the practices and institutions located within that territory-rather than the empire or nation-state that may claim ultimate sovereignty over the territory. Thus, a question about the government or judicial bodies seated within a British colony would refer to the governor-general and his local administration rather than the King/Queen or government of England.
Social Group: A social group is differentiated within a country by caste, ethnicity, language, race, region, religion, migration status, or some combination thereof. (It does not include identities grounded in sexual orientation, gender, or socioeconomic status.) Social group identity is contextually defined and is likely to vary across countries and through time. Social group identities are also likely to cross-cut, so that a given person could be defined in multiple ways, i.e., as part of multiple groups. Nonetheless, at any given point in time there are social groups within a society that are understood-by those residing within that society-to be different, in ways that may be politically relevant. Contrast Identity group.
Social Media: Social media are a subset of Internet platforms that enable normal individuals to create and share content with networks of other people. Social media platforms are available to the public, although content on such networks may be shared privately within subgroups of users. Social media includes both publicly visible, or semi-public platforms, like Facebook, Flickr, Friendster, Google+, Instagram, Myspace, LinkedIn, Twitter, VKontakte, and Weibo and private social networking and messaging platforms like Signal, Slack, Snapchat, or WhatsApp.
Socio-Economic Position: Socio-Economic position defines groups based on attributes of wealth, occupation, or other economic circumstances such as owning property. Exclusion of economic groups occurs when, for example, those who are not property owners are restricted from voting, or when fees associated with justice, health or education are set at a rate that is unaffordable for poorer individuals.
Specialized Court: Specialized courts have jurisdiction restricted to particular areas of the law outside of criminal and civil law. Examples of specialized courts include administrative, commercial, immigration or environmental courts. We exclude constitutional courts from this category.
State: A political organization that organizes compulsory domination over a fixed territory on a continual basis.
Upper Chamber: The upper chamber in a bicameral legislature, often called the "senate" or sometimes the "first chamber," typically means the less numerous chamber that is also less directly representative of the general population. If you are considering a semi-sovereign territory, such as a colony, please consider the upper chamber of the legislature that is seated within the territory in question (such as the "senate" or upper chamber of a local legislative assembly in a British colony, not the House of Lords in London).
Variable:	A measure of a small number of attributes. Synonymous with "indicator."
Variety of Democracy: A loose term that could refer both to conceptions of democracy (as defined above) and to other notions of democracy, such as direct democracy (which in our conceptual scheme is a property of participatory democracy).

14 Appendix D: Post-Survey Questionnaire
Instructions to the coders (as shown in the surveys)

Post-survey questionnaire: Please answer this set of questions after you have completed all other sections of the survey. It consists of questions about your personal background and political perspectives, as well as some general questions about democracy. Answers to personal questions will remain strictly confidential.
Principles of democracy: There are many ways of conceptualizing democracy. In the following section, we ask about your own views of this subject. Specifically, we ask you to consider seven conceptions of democracy-electoral, liberal, majoritarian, consensus, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian. After a short description of each conception, we ask you to rate how strongly you support this conception of democracy on a standard Likert scale (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree).
We are interested in your own views of the subject, i.e., how closely these various conceptualizations fit with your intuitive sense of what democracy means, or should mean. When you say "democracy," what do you mean to communicate? How do you think the concept is most usefully defined?

14.1.13	Democracy Scores (C) (v2zzdemsc)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: What democracy score would you assign to the following countries on a 0-100 scale?
Clarification: Imagine a scale that measures the degree of democracy-autocracy in countries around the world, stretching from 0 to 100. 0 represents the most extreme autocracy in the world and 100 represents the most democratic country in the world.
These scores are meant to represent the state of regimes across the world, not ideal-types. Thus, countries could become, over time, more autocratic than the most autocratic country in the world, or more democratic than the most democratic country. And they may have been so in the past. All we are concerned about here is the state of regimes.
Because some regimes are undergoing rapid change, it is important to clarify a specific date. Your coding should reflect the state of democracy in a country on 1 January, 2012.
In assigning scores we ask that you apply your understanding of democracy. This need not accord with the vision of democracy embraced by extant indices (Freedom House, Polity, et al.) or with the perspective of the V-Dem project (which embraces a variety of models of democracy).
All we ask is that you consider democracy-autocracy on a unidimensional scale. Of course, we realize that democracy is much more complicated than this. But we feel nonetheless that important information can be captured in a single dimension and we want to know how you view the subject.
We realize that you know more about some of these countries than about others. Do not be concerned by this. Simply enter the score that represents your best estimate.

14.1.15	Electoral democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzelcdem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The electoral principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The electoral principle - also known as contestation, competition, elite, minimal, realist, or Schumpeterian - is the idea that democracy is achieved through competition among leadership groups, which vie for the electorate's approval during periodic elections before a broad electorate. Parties and elections are the crucial instruments in this largely procedural account of the democratic process. Of course, many additional factors might be regarded as important for ensuring and enhancing electoral contestation, e.g., civil liberties, an active media, a written constitution, an independent judiciary (to enforce the rules of the game), and so forth. However, these factors are viewed as secondary to electoral institutions.
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.

Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.16	Liberal democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzlibdem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The liberal principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The liberal principle identifies democracy with limited government, rule of law, and the preservation of individual liberties. The liberal model assumes a "negative" view of political power insofar as it judges the quality of democracy by the limits placed on government. Principles and procedures must be established so as to ensure that rule by the majority does not result in the loss of individual liberties.
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.
1: Somewhat disagree.
2: Neither agree nor disagree.
3: Somewhat agree. 4: Strongly agree.
Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.17	Majoritarian democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzmajdem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The majoritarian principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The majoritarian principle (aka responsible party government) reflects the principle that the will of the majority should be sovereign. The many should prevail over the few. To facilitate this, political institutions must concentrate power (within the context of competitive elections). In practical terms, this means strong and centralized parties, a unitary rather than federal constitution, plurality rather than proportional electoral laws (or PR with high statutory thresholds), and so forth.
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.
1: Somewhat disagree.
2: Neither agree nor disagree.
3: Somewhat agree. 4: Strongly agree.
Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.18	Consensus democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzcondem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The consensus principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The consensus principle is the idea that democracy is achieved when consensus is achieved. This means that new policies should not be adopted by a polity unless and until a consensus (or near consensus) is reached. In order to assure that the principle of consensus is honored institutions should be set up in such a way as to assure that power is dispersed across numerous independent (or quasi-independent) bodies. In practical terms, this means a large party system or diffusely organized parties, a federal constitution, proportional electoral rules, and so forth (directly contrary to the majoritarian conception).
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.
1: Somewhat disagree.
2: Neither agree nor disagree.
3: Somewhat agree. 4: Strongly agree.
Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.19	Participatory democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzprtdem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The participatory principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The motivation for participatory democracy is uneasiness about delegating complete authority to representatives. Direct rule by citizens is preferred, wherever practicable. And within the context of representative government, the participatory component is regarded as the most democratic element of the polity. This model of democracy thus highlights the importance of voting, but also of citizen assemblies, party primaries, referenda, social movements, public hearings, town hall meetings, and other forums of citizen engagement.
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.
1: Somewhat disagree.
2: Neither agree nor disagree.
3: Somewhat agree. 4: Strongly agree.
Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.20	Deliberative democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzdeldem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The deliberative principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The deliberative principle focuses on the process by which decisions are reached in
a polity. A deliberative process is one in which public reasoning focused on the common good motivates political decisions-as contrasted with emotional appeals, solidary attachments, parochial interests, or coercion. In this conception, democracy requires more than a mindless aggregation of existing preferences; there should be respectful dialogue at all levels-from preference formation to final decision-among informed and competent participants who are open to persuasion. Some political institutions have a specifically deliberative function, such as consultative bodies (hearings, panels, assemblies, courts); polities with these sorts of institutions might be judged more deliberative than those without them. However, the more important issue is the degree of deliberativeness that can be discerned across all powerful institutions in a polity (not just those explicitly designed to serve a deliberative function) and among the citizenry.
Responses:
0: Strongly disagree.
1: Somewhat disagree.
2: Neither agree nor disagree.
3: Somewhat agree. 4: Strongly agree.
Data release: 1-13. Available in coder-level dataset.
14.1.21	Egalitarian democracy sympathy (C) (v2zzegldem)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: The egalitarian principle is an important, perhaps even essential, element of democracy. Do you agree or disagree?
Clarification: The egalitarian principle of democracy stresses that formal political rights and civil liberties are insufficient for political equality. The polity should also address material and immaterial inequalities that inhibit the actual exercise of these rights and liberties. Ideally, groups - as defined by income, wealth, education, ethnicity, religion, caste, race, language, region, gender, sexual identity, or other ascriptive characteristics - should have approximately equal participation, representation, agenda-setting power, protection under the law, and influence over policymaking and policy implementation. If such equality does not already exist, the egalitarian principle requires state efforts to make the distribution of socio-economic resources, education, and health more equal so as to enhance political equality. (This principle does not entail equality of power between leaders and citizens, as leaders in all polities are by definition more powerful.)

14.2.7	Democracy Scores (C) (v3zzdemsc)
Project Manager(s): John Gerring
Question: What democracy score would you assign to the following countries on a 0-100 scale?
Clarification: Imagine a scale that measures the degree of democracy-autocracy in countries around the world today, stretching from 0 to 100. 0 represents the most extreme autocracy in the world today and 100 represents the most democratic country in the world today.
These scores are meant to represent the actual state of regimes across the world today, not ideal-types.

16 Appendix F: Changes Between Previous Versions of the Dataset
16.1 New in Version 12 compared to version 11.1
• New indicators
- Regime ID (v2regidnr)
- Regime duration (v2regdur)
• New external variables
- GDP (e_gdp)
- GDP per capita (e_gdppc)
- Population (e_pop)
• Removed indicators
- COVID-19 government restrictions (v2cvgovres)
- COVID-19 affected ratings (v2cvresp)
• Removed external variables
- GDP growth (e_migdpgro)
- GDP growth (rescaled) (e_migdpgrolns)
- GDP per capita (e_migdppc)
- GDP per capita, logged, base 10 (e_migdppcln)
• Other new or modified information
- Updated list of countries.
- Updated citations for V-Dem's reference materials.
- Updated Country Coding Units document.
• Removed versions of indices and indicators
- Historical V-Dem indicators with v3-tags are continuously merged with the corresponding contemporary V-Dem v2-indicators. This results in the removal of v3-indicators, but extension of the time series (further back in time) of the corresponding v2-indicators. The year coverage is indicated in the "years" section for each variable entry.
16.2 New in Version 11.1 compared to Version 11
• Bug fix
- For v11 there was a mistake in aggregating a number of A and A* variables from country-date to country-year by using the wrong aggregation method, most often using maximum instead of last or last instead of maximum per country-year. Most indices were not affected by this as they get calculated using country-date inputs. The following indices were affected and were recalculated for v11.1, the number of changed observations in comparison to v11 are in parenthesis: v2x_horacc (all), v2x_accountability (all), v2x_veracc (all), v2x_diagacc (all), v2x_divparctrl (45), v2x_feduni (8), v2x_regime (24), v2x_regime_amb (25), v2x_ex_confidence (17), v2x_ex_direlect (8), v2x_ex_hereditary (21), v2x_ex_military (52), v2x_ex_party (27). The affected A and A* variables were re-aggregated using the correct method for v11.1.
- The coder-level dataset has been reuploaded for v11.1 such that the coder_ids are comparable across coder-level datasets. Non-identifying post survey questionnaire variables have been added.

• Historical V-Dem
For this version of the dataset we are for the first time including Historical V-Dem. The integration of Historical V-Dem with V-Dem means that many countries have data coverage on numerous V-Dem indicators from 1789 to the present. Historical V-Dem also contains several extra, historical polities that have ceased to exist, such as Bavaria and the Two Sicilies. To find more details about which countries are coded for historical V-Dem please refer to the country table (p. 15) or the Country Coding Units document.
Further, Historical V-Dem introduces several new indicators on various institutional features, some of which were particularly relevant for 19th century polities. To find more details on the Historical V-Dem variables please refer to the Historical V-Dem section of the codebook (p.
33).

- The information in the codebook about Male suffrage (v2msuffrage), Female suffrage (v2fsuffrage) and Suffrage (v2asuffrage) has been corrected to indicate that responses are given in percent.
- Income inequality, Gini (e_Unequal_UTIP) has been corrected to measure whether the Gini coefficient is above the mean.
• Other new or modified information
- Updated list of countries.
- Updated list of variables.
- Updated citations for V-Dem Reference materials.
- New citation for Ordinal versions of V-Dem's indices (Lindberg 2016).
- Gaps in coding periods should be interpreted as including the start and end year of the gap. For example, Germany is coded 1900-1945, 1949-2016, which means that the years 1946, -47, and -48 are excluded from the dataset.
- Freedom of expression index (v2x_freexp) was included in Electoral democracy index (v2x_polyarchy) in v6. This has been fixed for v7, where the Expanded freedom of expression index (v2x_freexp_thick) instead is included in the Elecotral democracy index.
16.9 New in Version 6 Compared to Version 5
• Changes:
- All CSV files are now encoded in UTF-8. When importing CSV data on platforms where UTF-8 is not the default, ensure that the correct encoding is specified in order to properly render diacritics for text variables.
- v2x_suffrage and v2elsuffrage have been modified with small changes to their respective comprising indices.
• Bug fixes:
- Superfluous variables corresponding to the means of the binary versions of the following variables have been removed: v2exdfdshg, v2exdfdshs, v2exdjcbhg, v2exctlhg, v2exctlhs, v2exrmhsol, v2exrmhgnp.

16.9 New in Version 6 Compared to Version 5
- Country specific coding periods were previously incorrectly set for the 6.1 country-date dataset. As a result, 279 observations falling outside of the V-Dem coding periods have been removed.
- Missing data for the variables v2expathhg and v2exaphogp for Serbia from 1900 to 1941 have been filled in.
- A bug was fixed regarding the ordinalization of indices. Previously, for the corresponding 5 category ordinal variables, observations that were meant to be 0.75 were incorrectly set as 0.5.
• New indices and indicators
- Civil liberties index
- Private civil liberties index
- Physical integrity rights index
- Political civil liberties index
- Additive polyarchy index
- Multiplicative polyarchy index
- Divided party control of legislature index
- Division of power index
- HOG term length by law
- HOS term length by law
- Election voter turnout
- Primary school enrollment
- Secondary school enrollment
- Secondary tertiary enrollment
- Political equality comments
• Modified indices and indicators
- Electoral democracy index has been updated with a new aggregation formula.
• Other new or modified information
- Providing a standard calculation for standard deviation which is marked with the suffix "sd" (e.g., v2elmulpar_sd). The SD might be used to compute the standard frequentist confidence intervals.
- Providing uniqueness scores to the structure of aggregations-all indices and indicators. Uniqueness is the variance that is 'unique' to the variable and not shared with other variables. It is equal to 1-communality (variance that is shared with other variables). Factor loadings are the weights and correlations between each variable and the factor. The higher the load the more relevant in defining the factor's dimensionality. A negative value indicates an inverse impact on the factor.
- Updated lists of number of variables.
- Updated list of countries.
